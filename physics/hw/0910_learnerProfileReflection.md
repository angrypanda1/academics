# Learner Profile Reflection

1. Which two (2) of the ten attributes listed on the IB Learner Profile would you say are your strongest areas (your strengths)? Why?

My strongest IB attributes are __Open-Minded__ and __Risk-takers__. These are my strongest attributes because I am always willing to try new things and take risks because that's the only way to learn -- if you stay in your comfort zone, nothing gets done. 

2. How might you be able to use your strengths as part of your contribution to class activities and atmosphere?

I can use my strengths to encourage other people to try new ways of thinking. I love debating, even though I never win :)

3. Which area (or areas) would you say are your growth areas? What might you do this year to grow in that area, and/or how might others be able to help you grow in that area?

The area that I would most like to grow in is __Communicators__. I feel like I never get through to people, and I would like to improve that this year by getting out of my comfort zone and speaking in front of the class -- online, no less.
