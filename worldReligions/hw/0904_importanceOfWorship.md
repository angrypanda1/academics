# The Importance of Worship to Humankind
## Question
Why is worship so important to humans?
## Evidence
- Worship has been an important part of humankind
    - However, Christians have tried to change from symbols (inspired from Pagans) to abstract ideas without much success (according to author)
- Humans use physical senses to survive, so religion uses physical symbols to relate to people
    - Holy visions are described with physical properties; this is the only way other humans can understand (maybe because it is the one thing that __most__ of us have in common?)
    - To help with this, priests use symbols to help people who are new to religion; examples are cave symbols painted in 24000 BC
- However, people were careful to warn that the symbols weren't actually god itself
    - However, people didn't really understand this and continued worshipping the statue, thinking it was God
- Humans cannot live without belief in a Supreme Being
- Humans will worship in many different ways, but will criticize other people about their methods of worship
    - However, different myths from different religions have a lot in common
    - Therefore, the basis of belief/religion comes from the same Source
    - However, when humans denounce this _basic fact_, the essence of religion is lost
- Two types of religion: polytheism and monotheism
    - Monotheistic religions are more aggressive towards each other on the genuineness of their worship
    - Polytheistic religions are more forgiving
- C.G. Jung states that humans have everything required inside them to create a myth -- all of this resides on the collective unconscious, or a bunch of universal images that exist in every human; example -- don't kill other people. 
- Religious archetypes have both positive and negative aspects. 
    - In the Western world, religion is used more often to oppress people; an example is churches support the powerful to gain power
    - If the church focused on the ordinary people, there would be less conflict
- _Humankind knows there is a Supreme Creator_. 
    - This compulsion drives us to create religion
    - Humans jump from religion to religion until the find the one that draws them the closest to the Source of all religion

## Conclusion
Humans cannot stop themselves from worshipping a Supreme Creator; some people use physical symbols, some people use abstract ideas, but humans cannot live without the belief in a Supreme Creator. Humans have to find a religion that draws them as close as possible to the Source of all religion; the collective unconscious, according to C.G. Jung.
