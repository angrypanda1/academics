# Puja Exit Slip
1. On an exit slip to post on Canvas, by the end of the period, explain how any three beliefs in Hinduism come into practice in Hindu puja.

- **A preference for one deity while not excluding others**: A puja itself is simply a worship ritual performed by Hindus to offer homage to one or more deities. 
- **Moksha**: Hindus usually perform *pujas* to attain *moksha* after they die thanks to their devotion towards a god (or gods). 
- **Circular symbolism**: Part of the *puja* is the *aarti*, where light is carried in a circular motion clockwise around the Lord. This circular motion is prevalent in many other Hindu concepts, like *samsara*.
