# Questions to Ask
1. Who is the titular parasite?

The titular parasite is every family in the movie. The Kims are obvious -- they infiltrate the Park's family and take their money, __even though the Parks can comfortably__ support them. The Ohs take advantage of the Parks to hide Geun-sae in the sub-sub-basement from creditors. The Parks cannot survive without the two families and accidentally pit them against each other.
- Is the antagonist the society that creates them?

2. Why did this film resonate so profoundly in the pre-pandemic world?

Class conflict is always a popular topic for directors and writers -- it's been that way since Animal Farm. This was no different

3. To what extent does this film gain more profound significance while sheltering in our new pandemic-isolated bubbles, where we're not at all in the same boat but we're in the same viral storm?

4. Compare/contrast this film with Ursula LeGuin's short story _The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas_: who suffers so that others can be happy in Parasite?

5. Compose a Marxist critique of the film -- what does the film show about the individual's role in class struggle? THe distribution of wealth? The role of creative fiction in identifying paralyzing sociological riffs?
6. Analyze the role of (food, wealth rock, flood, morse code, another motif you noticed) imagery in the film
7. What is the role of love and marriage in Parasite? Evaluate each marriage in the film individually. Then compare and contrast the three marriages to show what the film says about the institution. 
## Evidence
- Narrow street in their house vs wide street in rich house
- Lots of levels; sloping road uphill, stairs up to the house, lots of levels in the house
- People pretending to be deep about paintings and stuff -- "so metaphorical"; practicing a script
