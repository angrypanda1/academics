# Daoism Introduction

1. The Dao is a way of living that all Daoists follow. The "way" in Daoism basically reasons that as human life is basically insignificant, the best way to live is to live in accordance with Nature (with a capital N). 
2. Daoism split into several sects due to Western influence in China, such as Orthodox Daoism. Additionally, more Western philosophers traveled to China to study Daoism and (unsuccessfully) tried to bring a greater understanding to Daoism.
3. Classical Daoism focuses on philosophy in Daoism while Folk Daoism focuses on religion itself in Daoism. 
4. As different kingdoms began taking power in China, parts of Daoism evolved into agnostic confucianism, which evolved into Confucianism, which is still quite popular today. 
5. The Celestial Master school, which was the more orthodox, popular school, was abolished when the Master of its school had surrendered to the ruler of the Wei kingdom. The other school, Complete Perfection Daoism, was founded during the Jin dynasty which focused on achieving perfection. 
6. As Chinese Daoists began to immigrate, the religion traveled with them, such as throughout Southeast Asia. Daoism is also an important part of Chinese alternative medicine, like acupuncture. However, (as usual) Chinese Daoism was seen as inferior by other Western Daoists. 112
