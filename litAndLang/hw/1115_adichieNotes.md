# Adichie's *Americanah*

* Princeton smells like nothing, but the narrator describes what her other senses see; locals with their expensive cars, different tasting ice creams, and effusive greetings at the entrance of the post office
* Acknowledges Princeton's exclusivity, like she's part of an exclusive "American club"; quite similar to the narrator's feelings when he was accepted into Princeton in *The Reluctant Fundamentalist*
* However, as usual, there's discrimination beneath the surface; she has to go to Trenton to braid her hair
* She writes a social justice blog using on-the-spot interviews with random people that she's met
    * One person said that race is overhyped and class is what matters
    * Another said that nobody wants to adopt black children
* However, as she wrote more in her blog and her blog became more popular, she became more insecure about her views and tried harder to find little nuggets of gold in people's conversations
* When she realizes that she's fat, she also realizes that she misses her "true" home, Nigeria; god she's such a little bitch omg
