# Internet Pujas
## Question :question:
How has technology affected Hinduism?
## Evidence :book:
- *Puja* is a moment of connection with a deity, usually trough visual means
- However, people who live far away from holy areas (e.g. temples) use **internet pujas**. There are two types:
    - Request a puja to be performed for them at a temple; this gives access to temples that are difficult to reach; it even "democratizes worship" since lower castes/women are usually not allowed to do *pujas*. However, in some cases, the authority for keeping certain groups out shifts to the puja companies rather than the temple and nothing changes
    - The other type is fully online; an online shrine with buttons to give offerings. However, Hindus don't really like this because the computer is used for work and...other reasons. 
## Conclusion :see_no_evil:
Technology has made religion more accessible to people, but it also has created new problems dealing with the ethics of the inclusion of technology in religion.
