# Christianity Case Study -- Gender

* Catholic/Orthodox/Evangelical churches have taken strong stances against homosexuality

* Episcopals/Presbyterians/Lutherans have taken strong stances for homosexuality

* An example of this divide in Christianity is best seen in the United Methodist Church, which takes a stance against LGBTQ, but a large portion of its members support the LGBTQ community and say that the UMC's position against gay people is "wrong, stupid, and evil."

* Additionally, some other people in the UMC have called for sanctions against those supporting LGBTQ rights

* The groups recognizing and not recognizing LGBTQ rights fall upon mostly geographical/cultural lines; Asian/African methodists oppose LGBTQ rights, while the majority of American Methodists support them
