4. Why did you choose this topic?

My parents have a dislike of Islam due to being discriminated against by Muslims in their hometown, so I always wanted to know for what reasons Muslims have so much hate towards other religions. IT seems like the gap between Hinduism and Islam is getting wider and wider with the BJP in power and the Kashmir conflict.
