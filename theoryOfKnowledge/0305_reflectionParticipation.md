# Reflection Participation -- Week 3

1. I am part of Group B, Ananta's group about discovery. 

2. What makes a discovery significant?

   ANSWER: Truth, validity, and importance all play a big role in making a discovery significant. However, it depends on what context the discovery is significant in. Shared knowledge in general? Advancing a certain science? It all depends. 

3. I can use this information in my own life by considering if what I say or research actually has any meaning. For example, if I find something I think is useful and I want to share, I will consider if my discovery will contribute anything meaningful to the conversation. 
4. One additional RLS I would have included is scientific paradigms in the field of atomic theory. Many early discoveries in the field of atomic theory were fales, but still were significant because they contributed to later, (hopefully) correct theories about the structure of atoms. Scientific paradigms in almost every field would complement this presentation quite well.
