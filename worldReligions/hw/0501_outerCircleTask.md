# "Outer Circle" Task

---

1. Pick the three terms that seem the most interesting to you

   * **Identity**
   * **Power**
   * **Change**

2. Define them generally, as you understand them, in your own words. 

   * **Identity: ** The amalgamation of characteristics a society strives towards
   * **Power**: Who is responsible for the well-being of the majority of society 
   * **Change**: How the identity of a society develops over time

3. Define each of them in relation to your understanding of religion(s). Do this for each word. 

   * **Identity**: Why does this certain religion exist? What purpose does it have? 
   * **Power**: Who is in charge of the religion?
   * **Change**: How do the goals and content of the religion develop over time, and for what reasons?

4. Give an example of the intersection of your definition of the term and one religion we have studied in class this year. Do this for each word (but pick one example from any religion we've studied -- you do NOT have to have one)

   I will be using Hinduism for my examples. 

   * **Identity**: The identity of Hinduism is to use stories as ideal ways to live your life -- Aesop's Fables on steroids. Additionally, unlike most other religions, most of the gods in Hinduism (other than the big 3 -- Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu) are almost human in their characteristics and make human mistakes, implying that Hinduism is a religion made up of a huge mixture of stories. 
   * **Power**: Power in Hinduism is made of different groups -- first, it's the gods Vishnu, Shiva and Gandharva, then the lesser gods, then various holy beings, then human castes. 
   * **Change**: Hinduism over time has changed from a peace loving religion into a vehicle for the anti-Muslim agenda of various modern politicians in India today, most notably the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.
