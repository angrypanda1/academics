# TOK Final

Most concepts we learned over the past 1 1/2 years were very beneficial in preparing me to write the TOK Essay. Learning about Plato's Cave in my first year allowed me to finally view the process of thought I was having while writing the essay as being affected by external stimuli, leading me to realize that whatever I wrote would never truly be my own opinion. Reading Kuhn's *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* this year helped me understand the concept of paradigms, which I used in my TOK essay to justify the change in the use of statistics over time. Additionally, learning to formulate knowledge questions in my first year helped me to create sub-knowledge questions for my TOK essay that allowed me to divide up the prescribed title into several smaller, more easily digestible questions. Finally, learning about Adichie's concept of "A Single Story" caused me to become wary of the argument I was making and try to acknowledge other counterarguments to offer a more balanced perspective in my essay. Learning about the Areas of Knowledge and the Ways of Knowing in my first year helped me connect my argument to more tangible ideas rather than abstract ones.
