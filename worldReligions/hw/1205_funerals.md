# Technology and Funeral Practices

- Chinese government asked people to stop bringing strippers to funerals wtf
- At first there was hell if people didn't become immortal, but it eventually evolved into an alternate world where people continued to learn more about Daoism
- Reverence for ancestors eventually became very important because it would connect the dead and alive (BALANCE GOOD)
- There's a Day of the Dead in Daoism too; Hungry Ghost Festival is when people leave out food and other items to have the ghosts leave them in peace
- *Qinming* is when people clean the tombs of their ancestors; however, because there's so many people, the Chinese government is asking for dead people to be cremated rather than buried. 
- The Chinese government is offering incentives to cremate, like a coffin buy-back program which is gradually causing cremation to be seen as good in Daoism
