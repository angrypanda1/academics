# TOK IA Reflection

> What is your reflection group letter & what presentation are you reflecting on? 

I am part of Group B, and I am reflecting on Kate's presentation, which discusses Princess Diana. Their knowledge question is: "How does personal knowledge impact perception of authority?"

> What was the greatest strength of the presentation? Why?

I thought that their application to other Real Life Situations, like the scientific method and the evolution of religions, was particularly apt in showing other applications of the answer to their main knowledge question. The situations they described were a very good fit for their knowledge question. Additionally, I thought that their exploration of different perspectives to answer the question caused a well-balanced, nuanced conclusion to be created. Conjecturing about Princess Diana's perspective and reason for her "rebellious" actions allowed them to conclude that emotion and perception changes personal knowledge, which changes how people view different authorities. 

> What was an aspect that surprised you, or you had not thought of, in the presentation? How does that transfer in to your "real life"? 

An aspect of the presentation that surprised me was the fact that they tried to consider Diana's perspective by saying that Diana had to stay within an image of being a princess, but thought she could break traditional conventions while staying as a conventional, good ruler. I can use this in my real life by considering what other people think of in an argument, and why they are doing certain actions that at first glance, seem aggressive and useless to me. 

> Which TOK Aim did this presentation best address (please make this something different than what you already talked about in 1 & 2). Justify your answer. 

This presentation addresses the TOK Aim, "develop an awareness of how individuals and communities construct knowledge and how this is critically examined", since it explores how individuals examine knowledge through the perception of authority. They have differing reactions based on how they perceive the authority -- if they view the authority favorably, they view the knowledge the authority disseminates as true and unrefutable, and vice versa.
