1. Identify **three** teachings about the Dao in this passage. 

* It is best to live a life of inaction in order to "see the Heavenly Dao" or to attain enlightenment; this is called *wu wei*, or a life of inaction
* Pursuing something to a certain extent is fine, but after that, it upsets the balance and your inner *Qi*. 
* You should use *Neidan*, or internal alchemy (basically just trying to make your mind empty of all thoughts; "without going out the door, without peering out of the window") in order to have an immortal spiritual body that can survive after death. 

2. Explain the importance of reconciling opposites according to Daoist teaching

The concept of balance in Daoism is extremely important. There is no good or bad opposites, just imbalance. Therefore, it is better to follow the laws of nature (*Li* )and live a life of inaction in order to have the two opposites gradually reconcile with each other without any interference from you. In fact, the reason that Daoism exists in the first place is that humans didn't appreciate the perfect balance that the world had before, trying to "improve" nature and imbalancing nature. In fact, Folk Daoists believe that if humans use internal (*Neidan*) and external (*Weidan*) alchemy in order to balance themselves they can attain supernatural powers. 

>  “If you wish to act in accordance with the Dao, live long and not die, you should first visualize these spirits, nourish their roots, and cause their qi to circulate.”

1. Identify **three** teachings in this passage. 

* If you live in accordance with the Dao, you will attain immortality because you are in balance with nature. 
* In order to do this, you can try to visualize *Shen Spirits* (good ghosts, basically) and use certain holy roots to make an elixir that when drank, gives you immortality. This form of alchemy is called *Weidan*. 
* *Qi* is an instrumental part of Daoism, and one of the three treasures. *Qi* is the life force found in every living thing. When it is circulated correctly through your body using the correct exercises, it is possible to attain immortality. 

2. Explain how long life is "in accordance with the Dao". 

Long life is a way of the Dao because having a balance with nature inherently allows you to live a long life, just like how eating healthy food allows you to live longer. However, this is only one version of Daoism, Folk Daoism, which encourages moderation to attain immortality, while Classical Daoism encourages moderation because it's good and with the Way; there is no reward.
