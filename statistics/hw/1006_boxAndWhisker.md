# Working with Box-and-Whisker Plots

1. The data below shows the number of raisins in each of 14 boxes (1/2 oz.) of three different brands of raisins: 

**Compute the median, lower and upper quartiles, and interquartile range for each data set.**
* *Median*: 26
* *Q1*: 24
* *Q3*: 28
* *IQR*: 4
---
* *Median*: 28
* *Q1*: 26
* *Q3*: 29
* *IQR*: 3
---
* *Median*: 26
* *Q1*: 25
* *Q3*: 27
* *IQR*: 2

**Construct three different modified box-and-whisker plots and place them on the same horizontal axis, labeling the axes and labeling Q1, Q3, the median and the mean on the boxes.**

**What conclusions can you make about the shape of the distributions by looking at the three box plots? Are the distributions symmetric or skewed in one direction? Justify your answer.**

For *Sun Tyrant*, the distribution is uniform. There are no outliers, the median is in the middle of the data set, and the quartiles are the same area. 

For *Sun Acrid*, the distribution is skewed towards the left. The 1st quartile is bigger than the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartile. 

For *Laminate Kist*, the distribution is normally distributed. The median is in the right place, and the quartiles are each the same area.

**For which brands are you more likely to end up with a box with a fewer raisins? Justify your answer.**

You are more likely to end up with a box with fewer raisins if you buy from *Sun Acrid*. You can see that the 1st quartile is bigger than the other quartiles, so you are more likely to get a number of raisins in the lower percentile. 

2. Here is a set of data of college GPAs from a sample of students who completed an AP course in statistics in their senior year at a fictional high school. 

**Construct a histogram of the GPA data using a class width of 0.3 and a minimum x-value of 1.9. Be sure to label both axes.**

**NOTE**: I meant to label the $x$-axis GPA. 

**Construct a modified box-and-whisker plot using the GPA data and report the values of the five-number summary, labeling the axes, and labeling Q1, Q3, the median and the mean on the boxes.**

**Describe the shape of the distribution of GPAs in terms of symmetry (is it skewed?) and outliers. Use evidence from the two types of plots to support your answer.**

The distribution is skewed towards the right. According to the histogram, there are 13 people with ranges from 3.4-4.0. Also, there are multiple outliers. According to the box plot, the IQR is 0.6, so values below 2.9 are classified as outliers. 

3. The Houses of Parliament in Ghyronmia (a hypothetical small country) have two political parties: the Purple Party and the Chartreuse Party. Twenty different “tax cut” bills came up in the most recent Parliamentary session. If senators voted yes, they were in support of a tax cut. The number of times (out of a possible 20) each senator voted yes is shown below:(8 points)

**Construct modified box-and-whisker plots for each data set on the same horizontal axis. Please indicate the values of Q1, median, and Q3 on the different plots.**

**Compute the IQR for each data set.**
* **IQR for Purple Party**: 4
* **IQR for Chartreuse Party**: 3.5

**Compare the shapes of the two distributions (skew and outliers) and the amount of variation in the distributions. What do these plots tell you about the policies of Chartreuse and Purples in this particular state during this particular legislative session? What do the outliers tell you about the behavior of a few of the senators?**

More Senators in the Purple Party voted "no" for tax cuts, while Chartreuse was the other way around. The outliers show that there both the parties are relatively unified. There is nobody in the party that disagrees completely with the rest of the party.
