# The Zen Diagram of Hinduism
## Question
Why is Hinduism so complex?
## Evidence
- Because Hinduism is so old and so geographically diverse, the beliefs that many Hindus have are very different from one another; this is why Hinduism is an **umbrella term**
- Hinduism has many concepts; these are some of the major ones:
    - Belief in the Vedas :book:
    - Karma :om:
    - Dharma :wheel_of_dharma:
    - Pujas :pray:
- The start of Hinduism is thought to be with the Indus River Valley Civilization; the stamps that they used to use have many Hindu motifs. However, the civilization didn't leave much texts, so we don't know much about proto-Hinduism in the Indus Valley
- Because Hinduism had so many sources, people had many different beliefs in their head -- *dharma* by the day, *Kama-Sutra* by night
    - Also, only rich people could read because the climate destroyed written text in like a month
- Oral sources were super different from each other too -- *Rig Veda* didn't change at all while the *Mahabharata* did
- The biggest difference is that between *oral and written*; written texts incorporate oral vernacular and vice versa
    - Because of this, lower social groups contributed a bunch to Hinduism; women were able to read and speak Sanskrit in plays, and (accidentally) caused men to write texts about women based on their interactions with their wives (and maybe others ;)).
## Conclusion
Hinduism is complex because it is one of the oldest religions, it is geographically diverse and therefore stems from language barriers, and it is not a religion that requires higher education to understand. 

## Questions
1. Compare and contrast how religious scholars tried to get a handle on Hinduism. Deduce what this tells us about the religion, its impact and the difference between being Hindu and Indian. 
   
Some scholars have tried to get a handle on Hinduism by identifying some common characteristics that all believers in Hinduism have -- that is, a belief in *karma*, *dharma*, and the *Vedas*. However, because Hinduism is so geographically diverse, you could also say that there are almost no similarities between Hindus in two different environments. Therefore, the concept of a **Zen Diagram** is created, in that there is no middle section that has common properties, like a conventional Venn Diagram.

Hinduism is so geographically diverse and huge that it had differing levels of impact everywhere it spread to. Hinduism is a way of life, not a religion, so if one followed Hinduism it usually had much more impact than other major religions than Islam and Christianity. 

As for the last part of the question, I think that there isn't much of a difference between being Hindu and Indian. Hindu is a communal religion that unites different groups of people together in different ways -- Brahmans discussed texts, while lower castes had folk traditions celebrating the deities. Hinduism defied India. 

2. Explain how the history of India dovetails with Hinduism and informs our understanding of the religion. 

With the caste system and language barriers, Hinduism evolved to be a multifaceted way of life. Folk traditions and holy texts like the *Mahabharata* changed hundreds of times over the years and evolved with Indian culture. However, texts like the *Rig Veda* have not changed for thousands of years. This unique combination of the changing and unchangeable have helped Hinduism become a diverse religion appealing to many audiences. 

3. Examine the importance of various texts in both a written and oral tradition. 

Both are equally important and both have their disadvantages. Written texts cannot be preserved for long, but as long as they are preserved, they are (mostly) unchanged, offering new converts a glimpse into the origins of Hinduism. With oral texts, the texts are much more likely to be preserved, but they are much more susceptible to change, evolving with India's culture. 

4. To what extent did women and the lower classes participate in the religious development of Hinduism?

tl;dr not directly. 

Women were portrayed as being able to read and speak Sanskrit in plays, so it is to be assumed that they at least had somewhat of a say in religious discourse. Even though texts like the Vedas kept shouting that women should not be allowed to participate in such discourse, it is evident that there must have been a reason that Hindus kept whining about women's participation. 

The lower classes had a say because of the uniqueness of the caste system. In other words, not all Brahmins were rich; some consorted with kings, while others begged for food. In this way, the poor brahmins, who were exposed to some of the lower classes' views, influenced Hinduism by echoing their views. 

5. Explain the importance of the *bhakti* movement. 

The bakthi movement emphasized humility and service over power and privilege. It empowered women and low castes, and therefore caused them to have a bigger say in Hinduism. The Bhakti movement also popularized the worship of goddesses. 

6. Explain how the British impacted Hinduism and Indian culture. 
- Influenced people to believe that there was "one Hinduism"
- Gave the Bhagavad Gita a bunch of clout so they could govern the Indians with it
- In the process, depopularized all the other aspects of Hinduism

7. Comment on how modern history and culture have impacted Hinduism. 

- When Indians came back from studying in London, they brought Britain's views of Hinduism back with them. 
- More marginalized groups have been coming out of the woodwork and writing about Hinduism
- Some people are producing Hindu texts in English
