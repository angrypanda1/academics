# Chapter 1 Discussion #

1. From page 1 “Those texts have, for example, often seemed to imply that the content of science is uniquely exemplified by the observations, laws, and theories used in gathering textbook data, together with the logical operations employed when relating those data to the textbook’s theoretical generalizations.” What does this passage mean? Does Kuhn think this is a good thing? Why/why not?

Kuhn is saying that the textbooks are quite pretentious in that they assume that all of science is in the theories and observations prevalent in the textbook -- nothing before. Kuhn doesn't think this is a good thing because he says later in the chapter that other, previous scientific theories were just as "scientific" as present-day ones. 

2. The result has been a concept of science with profound implications about its nature and development. What are the implications?

Kuhn is saying that all these textbooks are encouraging a singular concept of science; namely, the scientific method. However, Kuhn is implying that these textbooks don't consider other methods used to cause scientific development, which is wrong. 

3. "If science is the constellation of facts, theories and methods collected in current texts, then scientists are the men who...have striven ton contribute one ore another element to that particular constellation." **Explain the metaphorical language in literal terms. What does Kuhn mean?**

Kuhn is implying that science is made up of a group of facts; it is not singular, and that scientists are the ones trying to add more facts, or another "star", to science. 

4. “In recent years, however, a few historians of science have been finding it more and more difficult to fulfill the functions that the concept of development-by-accumulation assigns to them…. “Perhaps science does not develop by the accumulation of individual discoveries and inventions". How does science develop according to Kuhn? 

According to Kuhn, science develops by leaps and bounds. There are long phases where not much happens, but then somebody discovers something huge that upsets science and scientists assume that the new finding establishes the new normal. 

5. "What problems arise if "historians...[have] difficulties in distinguishes the 'scientific' component of past observation and belief from what their predecessors and readily labeled 'error' and 'superstition'? [When they study discarded ideas, they realize] those once current views of nature were...neither less scientific nor more the product of human idiosyncrasy than those today?" **Paraphrase his argument in this passage.**

Kuhn is saying that previous theories were equally as correct as theories today, because the theory at that time was correct according to the knowledge at that time -- the same as today.
