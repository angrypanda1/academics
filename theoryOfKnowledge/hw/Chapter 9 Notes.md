# Chapter 9 Notes

* Why should a paradigm be called a revolution? In other words, what makes a paradigm a revolution? 
* Paradigms are like political revolutions because it follows the same process -- a paradigm is introduced and eventually problems between two groups -- one supporting the paradigm, one not; eventually, the paradigm wins and the other is phased out of existence. Also, it's usually pretty violent, while not physically, emotionally.
