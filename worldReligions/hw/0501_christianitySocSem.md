1. Using specific, explain the fundamental differences in practice (not belief) between Christianity and Judaism and why those differences occurred. Expand upon why these religions, so similar in origin, seem so different. 

   The most important difference between Judaism and Christianity is the being that is emphasized -- Christians believe that Jesus is the messiah, whereas Jews acknowledge Jesus as a very good teacher and maybe even as a prophet of God, but definitely not the Messiah. In fact, this is probably the biggest reason behind the schism between Jews and Christian; Jews do not consider the New Testament canon, whereas the Christians do. 

   Secondly, Judaism has much more rules to follow than Christianity; According to Apostle Paul, "faith in Jesus guarantees a share in his life". Other than the Ten Commandments which provide a basis on which to live your life on, Christian texts do not mention many other rules, contrary to Judaism. 







2. To what extent is the United States of America a Christian nation? 

   The United States is a Christian nation to a greater extent due to the amount of people practicing the religion inside its borders -- according to Pew Research, about 65% of Americans in a survey described themselves as Christian. The next biggest religion in the US is Judaism, with 1.9%, a huge difference. Due to Christianity's relatively large popularity in the US, the US has adapted most of its customs to match Christian ones -- the biggest example being Christmas. Originally a Christian holiday to celebrate the birth of Jesus, Christmas has been turned into a national holiday, with the government legally requiring that no work be done on Christmas day; in addition, most companies and school districts give week-long holidays to accommodate the celebration of Christmas. 

   However, it is important to acknowledge that the U.S. Government itself was made to be a wholly secular government on purpose -- the only two mentions of religion in the US Constitution are in the First Amendment, which promotes freedom of religion; "Respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"; and in Article 6, which bars "religious tests" for public office (AU). 

   In conclusion, the United States is not an officially Christian nation, but due to the amount of Christians present inside its borders, the US has adapted its customs to match Christianity's.
