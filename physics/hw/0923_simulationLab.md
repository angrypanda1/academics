> This is not a linear relationship. What kind of curve fit/relationship does the data fit?

This data has an exponential relationship. 

> Linearize your graph. Explain, below, what you did to linearize your data, and show 1 sample calculation for that process

I took the logarithm of the forces acting on the mass. 
$$
\text{log}(1.67 \times 10^{-7}) = \fbox{$-6.777$}
$$

> What is the equation for your linearized graph? 

$$
N = -0.182m-5.95
$$

> Slope?

$$
-0.182\  N/m
$$

3. Data-based prediction: How might the relationships be connected? Are there any similarities among your results?

The relationships might be connected due to Newton's law of gravitation, which establishes a linear relationship between force and mass. Additionally, it establishes an exponential relationship between distance and force.
