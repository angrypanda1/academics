# The Reader -- Part 1

1. How does Schlink explore the idea of guilt in Part One?

   Schlink explores the idea of guilt in Part One by showing Michael's wavering embarrassment and guilt in terms of his relationship with Sophie. For example, when he sees Sophie dressing and is unable to stop himself from watching, he rushes out and is ashamed of himself for fantasizing about Sophie. When their relationship matures, Michael becomes ashamed of himself and his feelings for Sophie -- he is ashamed that he always begs for forgiveness from her, even though most of the time he is not the one at fault. He is also guilty about not telling his newfound friends about Hanna and feels that he is denying how important she is in his life.
