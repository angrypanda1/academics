# Omelas Pre Write

Prompt: Analyze the significance of LeGuin's narrative voice in this text.

LeGuin uses rhetorical questions and changes in description to draw the reader in and promote her view of the permanent existence of a scapegoat, showing how LeGuin's active lifestyle influenced her societal views. 

- "Joyous!...How describe the citizens of Omelas?" and "Do you believe Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy? No? Then let me describe one more thing."-- LeGuin uses these rhetorical questions interspersed between long paragraphs to draw the reader back in; also functions as a mood shift when she describes the plight of the child; shows how LeGuin can wrap complex themes in the guise of a casual conversation. 
- Uses changes in description to juxtapose the happiness of the city with the plight of the child; she says that the people can describe the city however they like, but she doesn't leave any room for speculation when describing the child; shows that Omelas is a metaphor for how you perceive happiness, but the child is a metaphor for the eternal scapegoat; there is no speculation involved with it (him? her? I don't know). This part shows how LeGuin was influenced by anthropological and psychological writings to observe the commonalities in every culture; that is, the existence of a scapegoat
