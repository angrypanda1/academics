# Distributions of Data
1. The following are the salaries of employees in a small business

| $15000$ | $15000$ | $17500$ | $23500$ | $23750$ | $25000$ | $26000$ | $27500$ | $29000$ | $45000$ |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|

**Before using your calculator, do you think that the mean or the median for these values will be higher? Why do you think so?**

The mean $\bar{x}$ will be higher than the median because the distribution is right skewed. 

**What are the mean and median of the salaries? Was your answer to (A) correct?**

**Median**: 24375
**Mean**: 24725

I was correct. The mean $\bar{x}$ was greater. 

**Find the standard deviation and the IQR of the data.**

$$s = 8708.59$$
$$Q_3 - Q_1 = 10000$$

**Describe the shape of the distribution terms of its overall shape, clusters gaps, or outliers, and skewness. Be sure to give the locations of the main features.**

The only outlier is 45000, and the distribution is positively skewed. There is one cluster centered around 15000 and another around 5000. There is a gap between 17000 and 23000

**Speculate on the reasons for why the distribution is shaped as it is.**

There might be one executive that makes much more money than his employees. The employees are also split into two groups -- one makes around 15000, while the other makes around 5000. 

2. Consider the following histogram: 

**Describe the shape of this distribution. Are there any gaps our outliers?**

The graph is negatively skewed. There are no gaps or outliers present. 

**Is the mean greater than or less than the median in this data set?**

The mean is less than the median in this data set because the distribution is negatively skewed. 

**The graph below shows a box plot of the data superimposed over histogram. Interpret the long whisker on the left in terms of the shape of the distribution, and explain why the median appears to be to the right of the center of the box.**

You can explain the long left whisker by taking a look at the distribution; it is negatively skewed. 

3. The following represents the outcomes of rolling a die 600 times. 

| Face   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| ---    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Number | 107 | 120 | 84  | 110 | 92  | 87  |

**What are the mean and median number of the number of times a face will appear?**

**MEAN**: 100

**MEDIAN**: 99.5

**What are the mean and median face value of the 600 rolls of the die?**

**MEAN**: 3.5

**MEDIAN**: 3.5

**Draw a histogram of the outcomes for the six faces. Describe the shape of the distribution you get.**

Graph is attached to bottom

The distribution is not uniform, it is **bimodal**. 

4. The data listed here are the weights (n pounds) of 29 packages of beef in a supermarket meat display. 

**Contract a histogram to display the distribution of weights, and describe the shape.**

Graph attached on bottom

The distribution is mound-shaped, or **unimodal**. There are no outliers present. 

**Find the mean and the median of the distribution.**

**MEAN:** 1.091

**MEDIAN:** 1.05

**Explain the difference of these two measures of center in terms of the symmetry or skewness of the distribution.**

The mean is greater than the median because the graph is slightly positively skewed. 

5. Following are a simple random sample of heights (in inches) of nandina bushes grown in a nursery. All bushes are all of the same species: 

**Characterize this distribution in terms of center and spread (variation)**

The spread is trimodal. The mean is 40.2 and the interquartile range is 19.9. 

**Draw a histogram and describe its shape.**

Graph attached on bottom

**Offer a theory as to why the shape looks as it does. Be sure to give the locations of the main features.**

There are three types of nandina berries, all grouped into 3 clusters. The first cluster might have been grown during a bad time for nandina berries; e.g. winter. The next group could have been grown in spring, and the last group could have been grown in summer. The range between the two gaps are $35.8 - 46.7$ and $24.5 - 29.8$. 

**What would be a good strategy for sorting and characterizing these data?**

Make 3 data sets, one for each cluster. 

**How do the mean and median compare? What do the IQR and standard deviation say about this distribution?**

The mean is slightly less than the median, meaning that the distribution is negatively skewed. From the IQR and standard deviation, you can see that the distribution is very spread out.
