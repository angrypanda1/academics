# Reflection -- Start of the Year
1. What does your home learning space look like? What do you like most about it? IF there is something you'd like to change about it, what is it and why?

My home learning space consists of one really huge room; me, my brother, and one of my parents work upstairs, while my other parent works downstairs whenever he/she has a meeting where he/she needs silence. The thing I like most about it is I have easy access to my parents; i can just turn around in my chair and ask them a question. However, there's not much privacy; in other words, I can't do anything else other than my homework under my parents' watchful eye :|

2. What worked well for you last spring when you were working from home? What did not really work for you last spring?

The thing that most worked well for me last spring was the fact that *everything* was online; I didn't have multiple resources to consult for information (in other words, the textbook and Wikipedia). However, the huge amount of different places I had to check online for teacher's HW and lectures was too much (Microsoft Teams, teacher's websites, Remind, etc.)

3. What are you most looking forward to learning in Physics this year?

I'm looking forward to learning about magnetic fields; I still don't quite understand the right-hand rule and am eager to get clarification on that topic. 

4. Do you have anything else you'd like to share with Ms. Fowler or with your future self (when you read this again)? 

Stay sane and don't slack off -- it'll be worth it when you get into a good college and they don't rescind their acceptance because of your crappy grades second semester.
