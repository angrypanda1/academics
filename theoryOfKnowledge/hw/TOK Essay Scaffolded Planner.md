1. **Name**: Svadrut Kukunooru

2. **TOK Essay PT**:

> 4. "Statistics conceal as much as they reveal." Discuss this claim with reference to **two** areas of knowledge.

3. **Possible Sub-Knowledge Questions**: 

* How does emotion play a role in the use of statistics by a governing body to conceal/reveal knowledge?
*  To what extent do statistics actually matter compared to how it's used/interpreted?
*  How does faith play a role in the use of statistics by a governing body to conceal/reveal knowledge?
*  How are the definitions of concealing or revealing something subjective rather than a constant?
*  To what extent does humanity require statistics, be it genuine or not, before believing in a part of any knowledge system, or is that assumption a modern societal construct? 

4. What does the title ask you to **discuss** (dig deep, not just surface) **AND** how **should you approach this discussion?**

The title asks me to take a two-pronged stance to this. The title explicitly asks me to compare the magnitude of two things:

1. What statistics conceal
2. What statistics reveal

However, that's not all. The next sentence asks me to connect this to two AOKs. However, I'm not really sure how I'm supposed to connect statistics, an inherently logical concept, to Areas such as indigenous knowledge groups or religious knowledge systems. Perhaps I can talk about the lack of statistics regarding these two areas, and show how that affects the faith in these systems? Do humans have to require data, be it genuine or not, before believing something, or is that a modern societal construct? I can explore this sub-question with an investigation into religious knowledge systems. 

On the other hand, I can investigate the impact of statistics on more logical areas of knowledge like mathematics and natural sciences and compare the amount of concealing/revealing to the indigenous/religious knowledge systems. 

5. Write your **overall, potential central argument** as a single statement: 

There is no way to tell if statistics conceal as much as they reveal because their relationships with different knowledge systems do not offer a reliable way to compare the amount of concealing with the amount of revealing. 

6. Counterclaim #1 -- what can be said against your central argument (answer to #5)

You can't say that you don't know if statistics conceals as much as it reveals because you can look at each knowledge system (or groups of systems), determine if the PT is true for that knowledge system, and then average out the results. 

7. Counterclaim #2 -- what can be said against the prescribed title in general -- against what is asserted in the prescribed title?

The title is too binary -- it only assumes there are two effects of statistics; to reveal and to conceal. This glosses over a large part of the use of statistics. 

8. Counterclaim #3 -- what other different sides or alternative perspectives to the prescribed title and/or your arguments not already brought up in #6 or #7?

Politics...partisan opinions are a huge part of deciding if statistics conceal rather than reveal. Hell, Andrew Yang's campaign was *based* on statistics. Also, I don't really where to put history on the spectrum of conceal vs. reveal. Also, it's a risky thing to talk about. 

9. What are the <u>two</u> AOKs you are thinking you will discuss? What might be <u>one or two</u> **WOKs** that would be the most relevant?

**Two AOKs**

* Indigenous knowledge systems
* Natural Sciences

**WOKs**

* Faith
* Reason

10. List & explain how your **real-life situations** contribute to your argument & counterclaims -- be specific, including verifiable and personal

    1. Me being super skeptical of Hindu religion; always asking for proof of the stories occurring in real life, and wondering how people automatically believed them as real -- maybe people's perception of stories was real because so many people around them also believed the stories; a sort of dummy statistics at work, or does this make the statistics real? Worth pursuing...
    2. Considering buying a product by looking at a review; didn't consider that the company might shell out millions to have good SEO (Search Engine Optimization), endangering other smaller companies who just want some people to look at their product. 
    3. Streaming music; the Spotify algorithms that give us those "Daily Mixes" are usually based on our past listening. However, that means that we always end up listening to the same style of artist, be it popular, indie, or metal. Unfortunately, I don't think there's any viable way to fix this unless somebody invents a completely new version of logic. 
    4. The superiority complex that people get from liking a certain thing, be it a type of music, art, person, etc. These people might possibly feel that they are "special" in some way because they perceive themselves as part of the minority, an "underdog" in a sense. However, what if they knew how many people in the world had the same tastes as they did?
