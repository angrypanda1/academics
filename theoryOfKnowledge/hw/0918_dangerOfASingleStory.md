# Danger of a Single Story - Adichie
## Answers
- Adichie says that she synthesized the knowledge she read in books and then simply regurgitated the same knowledge out. In other words, her perspective was clouded by the books that she read. Almost identical to the situation seen in Plato's Cave. Although I think by this point the ways Plato's Cave can be applied are fairly obvious...
- Adichie says children are particularly vulnerable to stories -- well, duh! Children do not have many sources of knowledge other than their parents and they are born hungry for knowledge, so they have a hard time distinguishing which knowledge is true and which knowledge is false. This fact, sadly, is manipulated in many ways -- take a look at the Hitler Youth and child soldiers in Africa. Also, they're more expendable. 
- Adichie says that when she discovered African books, she realized that people like her could also be present in African literature. This portion of her story, obviously, is the enlightenment when the prisoner walks out of the cave and realizes that there is more to the world than the shadows dancing on the walls of the cave. 
- Adichie says this same concept of hearing one thing be so emphasized that she didn't realize the thing being described had other characteristics -- for example, she was startled that a family could be productive even though they were super poor. 
- Adichie says that this also applied to other people's perspectives of her -- people automatically identified her as African, so therefore they felt pity for her because the majority of Africa was poor
- Adichie says that the stories that are written depend on the people in power; the people in power write stories that make them more powerful. The people in power are the people holding up the objects in front of the fireplace in Plato's Cave.
