*The Reluctant Fundamentalist* details the rise and fall in societal status and personality of a Pakistani immigrant, Changez, after the 9/11 attacks. Hamid starts the book with a description of the narrator's college years at Princeton, and one of his descriptions is particularly graphic: **"Every fall Princeton raised her skirt for the corporate recruiters who came onto campus and -- as you say in America -- showed them some skin...but even among all that skin, I knew in my senior year that I was something special. I was a perfect breast, if you will -- tan, succulent, seemingly defiant of gravity -- and I was confident of getting any job I wanted."**(6). Hamid uses the analogy of a girl raising her skirt to illustrate the impulsive, almost dangerous effects of Changez's perceived power from being at the top of his class in Princeton, showing the drastic effect of status on personality. Hamid uses this idea multiple times throughout the book when the narrator describes what he was feeling about himself (and America) after certain momentous events, like 9/11, ~~Erica goes to a mental institution~~, and when ~~he journeys to Pablo Neruda's house and he is reminded of his own life.~~
