LOOK FOR: 
- Interesting characterization elements
- Authorâ€™s purpose/theme
- Shifts in the narrative, enlightening moments for the characters or when it looks like the author is pinpointing something extremely important.
- Other literary devices that seem relevant to the form/structure of the writing. Not simply finding a simile for the sake of finding it.
