# Mindfulness in Silicon Valley

## question

How has Buddhism evolved when it has come into contact with new belief systems and ideas? 

## evidence

* Many Silicon Valley companies have invested in "mindfulness" training 
  * This training is mostly based on Theravada and Zen Buddhism
* Companies claim that this mindfulness training has increased productivity and profit and reduced employee stress; however, actual studies don't show much impact. 
* Additionally, many critics say that this type of mindfulness is fake and more neoliberalism- than Buddhist-inspired. Protesters say that the mindfulness training encourages employees to be unquestioning consumers and compliant workers. 
* Buddhism in Silicon Valley is more Theravada than Mahayana, focusing on self-healing rather than helping others. 

## conclusion

As Buddhism has come into contact with different economic systems and priorities, its uses and principles have gradually evolved to serve the interests of the people taking part in this practices.
