# HMT Intro Reading

1. What are you looking forward to in reading this work & why? 

   I watched a few episodes of the Hulu original *The Handmaids' Tale* when it came out, and even I could see the blatantly obvious symbolism in the dresses the women wore and the role they played in the Republic of Gilead. I'm looking forward to seeing a more nuanced interpretations of the symbols in the book version.
