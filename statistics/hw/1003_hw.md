# Standard Deviation and Variance
1. You're given a sample with $n=8$ measurements: $3,1,5,6,4,4,3,5$. 

**RANGE**
$$6-1 = \fbox{5}$$
**MEAN**
$$\frac{3+1+5+6+4+4+3+5}{8} = \fbox{3.875}$$
**VARIANCE/STANDARD DEVIATION**
$$\frac{(0.875)^2 + (2.875)^2 + (1.125)^2 + (2.125)^2 + (0.125)^2 + (0.125)^2 + (0.875)^2 + (1.125)^2}{8} = \fbox{2.109}$$
$$\sqrt{2.109} = \fbox{1.452}$$

The range is approximately $\fbox{3.5}$ standard deviations. 

2. Consider the following set of data, which represents a simple random sample of heights (in inches) of full-grown corn plants in Elephanteyetown, WI. 

**RANGE**: $\fbox{66.10}$

**MEAN**: $\fbox{62.41}$

**STANDARD DEVIATION/VARIANCE**: $\fbox{13.52}/\fbox{182.84}$

3. Consider the following set of data, which represents a simple random sample of heights of full-grown corn plants in Horseyetown, WI.

**RANGE**: $\fbox{80.3}$

**MEAN**: $\fbox{71.47}$

**STANDARD DEVIATION/VARIANCE**: $\fbox{15.76}/\fbox{248.36}$

4. In Goateyeville, MN, they use a new type of fish fertilizer. A random sampling of the heights of 20 full-grown corn plants in Goateyeville yields the following data. 

**RANGE**: $\fbox{46.1}$

**MEAN**: $\fbox{65.41}$

**STANDARD DEVIATION/VARIANCE**: $\fbox{12.34}/\fbox{152.17}$

5. Make Histograms. 
![Histogram 2](histogram2.jpg)
![Histogram 4](histogram4.jpg)

The histogram for #2 is symmetrical, while the histogram for #4 is skewed right. Their means are the same. However, the standard deviation for #4 is around 4 times that of #2. It seems that the standard deviation is strongly affected by skew.
