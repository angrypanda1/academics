Me and my friends founded a tutoring business, Future Tutors, which provides affordable tutoring for grades K-12. Here is our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/Future-Tutors-103106361356235/?modal=suggested_action&notif_id=1609539537664113&notif_t=page_user_activity&ref=notif

I am volunteering in the community by playing in Geetanjali Tamilband, a non-profit band that donates 100% of its proceeds to a nonprofit, Asha for Education, which funds the education of underprivileged children in India.
