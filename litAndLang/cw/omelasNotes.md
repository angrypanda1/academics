- Provide *objective* summary of the text and cite textual evidence to support what the text says (explicitly) 
- Show how the texts' central ideas are developed in the story
## Question
How was *The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas* influenced by the author's life?

## Evidence
- **AUTHOR**: Ursula Kroeber Le Guin (1929-2018)
    - Wrote a LOT of books
    - Did a lot of stuff; graduated from Harvard and did grad work at Columbia; married **historian Charles Le Guin** and had a big family; **LIVED A VERY FULL LIFE** which influenced her writing

## Conclusion
Due to Le Guin's eventful life; marrying a historian, writing a shit ton of books, being highly educated, her books contain many complex themes of morality and utilitarianism and a particular affection for history.
