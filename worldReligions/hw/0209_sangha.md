# Sangha Reading

* Buddhism came from 'renouncer' tradition; just renounce the normal way of life 
  * In other words, don't live the household life and start living the "religious" life, and depend on the population for your sustenance -- in other words, beg. 
  * Some people don't really want to beg, so Buddhists are divided into monks and lay Buddhist supporters
* There are several requirements for going forth (*pravrajya*) from the household life and becoming a Buddhist monk that must be met 
* Mostly just following a bunch of rules that if not followed, cause you to be punished.
