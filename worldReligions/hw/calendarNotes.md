# The Brazilian Calendar
Specific religious (or other) holidays; in other words, holidays I don't know about:
- Our Lady of Aparecida | Children's Day
- Corpus Christi
- Tiradentes Day
- Good Friday
- Carnival

## What holidays matter to this country and they related to religion?
Corpus Christi, Carnival and Good Friday all have to do with Christian days of observance. 

## Pick one holiday and describe its cultural and (if possible) religious connection and importance. 
- The Brazilian week-long holiday of Carnival honors the beginning of Lent, where Catholics abstain from eating meat

## Explain how this country's values are reflected in its calendar
Even though most of the Christian holidays are optional, almost everybody in Brazil observes them.
