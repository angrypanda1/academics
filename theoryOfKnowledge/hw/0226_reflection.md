# Reflection Participation: Week 2

1. What is your Reflection Group Letter & what presentation are you reflecting on?

   Group B: Isabelle's Group

2. What aspect of the IB Assessment Instrument was this presentation the strongest on -- what went well that IB was looking for? 

   I think their questions and perspectives that they talked about were the best. Their knowledge question was "How can perspective lead to shifts in knowledge", a very good KQ that I hadn't thought about before. This question has applications to almost all ways of knowing, since every WOK deals with the acquisition,retention, and prevention of loss of knowledge. The perspectives they provided, such as the Industrial Revolution's short-term benefits but long-term disadvantages for knowledge and the multiple ways you learned how to factor a quadratic equation, helped showcase that their knowledge question applied to almost every field, from history to mathematics. 

3. What was the most important information to you and your life shared in the presentation? Why?

   The most important information shared to me during this presentation was that I should consider that one's perspective has a huge impact on their knowledge. For example, somebody's predisposition towards a certain topic probably directly affects their knowledge of it, which is very obvious but I had never considered it before. 

4. What are comparisons and contrasts between this presentation and your own presentation?

   This question deals with the acquisition of knowledge; however, our presentation deals with justification whereas theirs deals with perspective.
