# Sarajevo Case Study
Make sure to keep in mind 4 **key** principles:
1. The academic study of religion is non-devotional
2. Religions are internally diverse
3. Religions grow/change over time
4. Religions are a product of the culture in which they exist. 
## Question :question:
How does Sarajevo show that religions can co-exist?
## Evidence :memo:
- Sarajevo contains a large group of religions because a bunch of empires invaded it and imposed their religions on it; however, they co-exist peacefully, which is rare
    - Christians actually had some positions of power in a Muslim-dominant city (97%)
    - Jews were not welcome in Spain because of the *reconquista* and traveled to Sarajevo because the Muslims were tolerant of "People of the Book"
        - These Jews attracted more Jews from places like Belgrade
- Because of this hotbed of religions, Sarajevo become a meeting point between Orthodox and Catholic Christianity
- However, when the Hapsburgs took over, Christians and Muslims started rising up against each other and Christianity came into power 
- After the Nazis, Josip Tito came into power and ruined things even more, imprisoning a bishop and being excommunicated from the Catholic Church; he didn't exactly disciminate against other religions but he made religion more divisive
-  Eventually shit got so bad that the city's Jews were forced to flee, thousands of Muslims were forced to work in camps, starve and die
- Now, everybody is chill, nobody in Bosnia-Herzegovina thinks religion is _super_ important
## Conclusion :detective:
Sarajevo illustrates the three major qualities of religion well because it shows that (a) co-existence is possible within the three ABRAHAMIC religions, (b) religion is influenced by outside political factors like the Nazis and Communists, and (c ) religions can grow/change over time (since everybody in Bosnia-Herzegovina is chill now about religion)

# Questions
1. Outline evidence and examples of how the religion in Sarajevo became tied to its culture, growing and changing with the city. 
- When the Ottoman Empire was in power, religious tolerance was rampant. Even though Muslims were the ones definitely in power (when you make up 97% of the population of the city you should be quite powerful) other Abrahamic religions managed to gain somewhat important positions of power. In other words, Muslims didn't discriminate against other religions (which, when we look at it now, Islam in some areas also grew and change a lot over time). 
- When the Nazis came into power, religious tolerance shrank into nothing. Even after the Nazis died out, Jews were forced to flee and thousands of Muslims were killed in the Bosnian Genocide. 
2. Explain the social situation involving People of the Book in Sarajevo for most of the Ottoman Empire using the frameworks provided by Galtung. 

Galtung coined the three types of violence: 
- Cultural Violence
- Structural Violence
- Direct Violence

For **structural peace/violence**, the Ottoman Empire didn't have extreme discrimination against other religions. However, the Ottomans still put all the Jews together in one section of the city, made them pay slightly higher taxes, and gave them a lower legal standing. 

For **cultural peace/violence**, we can see this by examining the Ottoman Empire's majority religion, Islam. The Q'uran, although it classifies people who do not follow Islam as infidels, still encourages Muslims to interact with other religions normally. 

For **direct peace/violence**, there isn't much direct conflict. More of a direct peace. 

3. Examine the historical and cultural reasons -- be sure to consider situatedness -- so many faiths existed for so long without conflict. Compare this to the situation in other parts of Europe and the Near East. 

The reason so many faiths existed so well without conflict is that people from each faith had unique circumstances that applied to them. For the Ottomans, they were the dominant power at the time, so they didn't need to feel like they needed to assert their religion by discriminating against others. Jews had fled from persecution elsewhere AND they were a really small minority, so they didn't feel that much of a conflict. Same with Christians -- even though they weren't persecuted, they only made up 1-2% the population of Sarajevo, and they knew they would be outnumbered if they started a conflict. 

4. Explain how the Austro-Hungarian Empire exacerbated religious tensions in the region. Consider why nationalism between ethnic groups conquered several hundred years of religious peace. 

Since the Austro-Hungarian empire was a majority Christian government, Christians finally felt like they were the ones in power. When Muslims lost power, they organized around their religion, and Christians copied them. Since both were acting like their religions were nations in themselves, politics began to become a huge factor in interactions between religions. 

5. Considering the methods of analysis we've discussed, examine why almost no countries acknowledge the plight of and consequently help the Bosniaks during the Yugoslav Wars. 

The countries around Austria-Hungary were majority Christian. Islam was only popular in the Middle East. Therefore, they didn't bother helping the Bosniaks because by then, people began to coalesce around a single religious group and make it more like a nation-state. 

6. Discuss how the war could impact religion in Sarajevo in both a positive and negative way. 
   
The negative is obviously the fact that thousands of Bosniak Muslims died during the Bosnian genocide. However, people realized the mistake of associating religion with politics and incorporated complete religious freedom in the Bosnia-Herzegovina constitution.
