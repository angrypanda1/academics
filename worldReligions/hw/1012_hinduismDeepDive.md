# Hinduism Deep Dive

The word I picked for my "deep dive" was *dharma*. 

**Dharma** is defined as:
> The idea that each person has a natural role or place in the world; also the notion of world interconnectedness. 

## Internal Diversity
Dharma in itself is an opinionated view of the "ideal" world. Therefore, it will already have many different definitions, even without the different sects prevalent in Hinduism. Some examples: *dharma* was originally defined by kings as the policies prevalent in each of their kingdoms. However, when the British invaded and when Buddhism spread over Asia, *dharma* was thought to mean law. In Jainism, the meaning is even weirder -- it is thought to mean an eternal "substance"
that allows beings to move around. 
## Growth and Change Over Time
As different empires flourished in Asia, the definition of *dharma* changed according to the opinion of the ruling class. When kings were focused on administrating and protecting their small kingdom from other invasions, *dharma* was mainly focused on the policies of their kingdom. When Buddhism spread to huge Chinese empires whose administrative tasks were the most important component, *dharma* was thought of as law in order to appeal to people living under the Chinese
empire. It was the same concept with the British as well; the British, already a minority in a Hindu-majority India, considered the concept of *dharma* law in order to find validation in Hinduism for their rule. 
## Cultural Embeddedness
*Dharma* is not very deeply embedded in everything modern-day Hindus do today. However, much of the original meaning of *dharma* has been lost; the British have reduced India into different religions that are all the mirror image of Christianity (The Print, Parathama Banerjee). However, *dharma* was very prevalent before the era of colonialism, with kings like Ashoka basing their entire rule around the concept of *dharma*. 
## Area of Study: Violence/Peace
*Dharma* has been used by empires in power to further their preferences for violence and peace. In times of turmoil, the British empire used the concept of *dharma* to help create *sanatana dharma*, which basically forced Hindus to do an "eternal" set of duties, one for each caste. Today, Hindu nationalists use the concept of *dharma* in their anti-Muslim rhetoric. The RSS, the biggest Hindu nationalist organization, says that "the ideal [of the RSS] is to carry the nation to
the pinnacle of glory, through organizing the entire society and ensuring protection of Hindu Dharma." (RSS). In other words, the RSS seeks to "bring Hindu scripture into Indian law and strip Indian Muslims of equal rights, or even expel them." (NPR).
