# "Omelas" and Parasite Discussion

**Option One, I choose YOU!**

Analyze who, or what, is the titular parasite?

I base my response upon the scientific definition of a parasite. According to the CDC, "a parasite is an organism that lives or on in a host organism and gets its food from or at the expense of its host." According to this definition, a parasite **harms** the host. In this case, neither of the poor families are parasites. Even though the Kims infiltrate the Park household, they do not financially or physically harm the Parks (except at the end, but that's a different story); if the Parks wanted to, they could comfortably support both families without breaking a sweat. However, the same can't be said for the Parks and ultra-rich people in general -- this group is a parasite on society, in a way, because their ultra-richness cause many people to live in ultra-poverty. 

This same concept of comparing the two families using a similar motif is repeated throughout the film:
- Levels: Parks live on the second floor on a steep hill, while the Kims live in a sub-basement in one of the city slums
- Water: Water causes the Parks to cancel their camping trip for Da-song's birthday party, while the same water causes sewage to overflow into the Kim's sub-basement and forces the Kims to sleep in a gym. 
- Art: The Kims don't care at all about art, but they pretend to be knowledgeable about it to appeal to the Park household's sense of superiority (since they care about art, they're better than the masses); "It's a chimpanzee! No, it's a self portrait"

These motifs prompt us to shift our attention to the facade of the rich Parks and help us to realize that the Parks -- and rich people in general -- are as much of a parasite as the masses.
