# IO Brain Dump

> - Determine one text and one work and one global issue that you will focus on for your 2020 IO/IA
>
> - Free-write on paper for thirty minutes (BRAIN DUMP/completion credit) analyzing how the author of the work and the text make choices to convey something about the global issue
>
> - Reflect to conclude your assignment, sharing your evaluation of the presentation of the global issue in both texts

*Work*: <u>*March*</u> - John Lewis

*Text*: <u>*Parasite*</u> - Bong Joon Ho

*Global Issue*: **Culture, Identity, and Community**

## March

* Book deals with the life of John Lewis and his role in the **civil rights movement**, which in itself deals with the changing of black culture in the US; going against the status quo against blacks
* Also deals with the changes *within* the civil rights movement and the divide between black supremacists like <u>Malcolm X</u> and more orthodox leaders like <u>Martin Luther King, Jr</u>
* Over the course of his childhood Lewis transitions from a (kinda naive) child to noticing the segregation evident in everything that they do; basically a change in his identity
  * Bad quality buses
  * Bad schools, textbooks, etc. 
  * No good roads
* The effects of culture or a changing culture on politics

## Parasite

* Movie deals with class conflict; every motif in the movie deals with the impassable divide between the poor and the rich in Korea
  * Levels motif; poor people live in a sub basement and rich people live on top of a big hill in a huge house. You can't go against gravity, or in other words, the status quo 
  * Can't get rid of the smell
  * Which class is the real parasite -- the rich or the poor?
* Effect of greed on class

## Conclusion

In **Parasite**, Bong Joon Ho uses the motifs of levels and smell to highlight the impassable divide between rich and poor. 

In **March**, John Lewis uses character development and conflict to show the divide between whites and blacks and how it was nearly impossible to cross the divide.
