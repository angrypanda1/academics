## Vectors

Vectors differ from scalars in that vectors have both magnitude and direction, whereas scalars only have magnitude. For example, velocity would be a vector whereas speed would be a scalar. You can add vectors together using several methods, but the best method to use is probably to the component method. For two vectors A and B, you find the x-component and the y-component of each component using the Law of Cosines, add the x-components and y-components of both vectors together to find the x- and y- components for the sum of the two vectors. Then, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude and direction of the vector. You can use vector addition to find how fast an object is moving relative to something, such as a plane moving relative to a tailwind/headwind. 

## Projectile Motion

Projectile motion in this case is two-dimensional, with an initial velocity, angle, and height. You can find the initial velocity at an angle because you know that velocity is a vector, so you can find the x- and y- components. Then, you can find the angle using the Law of Cosines. You can find horizontal distance buy finding the amount of time the object is in the air (using vertical kinematic equations) and multiplying the time by the horizontal x-component of the velocity. Horizontal velocity always stays constant, whereas vertical motion always increases linearly, with speed increasing about 10 mi/hr every second.

## Forces, Newton's Laws, and Momentum

There are three types of equilibrium -- static, translational, and dynamic. Static equilibrium occurs when an object is stable and at rest. Translational equilibrium occurs when the net force on an object is zero, but the object still may be moving. Dynamic equilibrium occurs when there is a tenuous balance between two occuring processes, but this type of equilibrium is more chemistry-related. 

Free-body diagrams can be made by making the object which the forces are acting on a rectangle, and the forces acting on the object as vectors emanating from that dot, with both direction and magnitude determining which force it is. 

There are several types of forces:

* Gravity, which occurs from the mass of an object
* Magnetic force, which occurs from the poles of a magnet
* Electrical force, which occurs from current
* Frictional force, which occurs from an object touching a non-smooth surface
* Tension force, which occurs from a rope or wire being pulled from opposite sides
* Normal force is the force that pushes back according to Newton's Third Law
* Air resistance force is like frictional force except for air
* Applied force is the force applied to an object, be it from a hand or a car
* Spring force occurs from a spring being stretched or compressed

Newton's laws of motion state that 

1. An object's motion stays the same unless it's acted upon by another force
2. Force = mass x acceleration
3. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction

Momentum is the amount of motion an object has. It can be calculated by multiplying the mass of the object by the velocity. Impulse is change in momentum. Like the conservation of energy, momentum is always conserved in an impact.

## Thermal Physics

The law of thermal energy transfer states that heat is always transferred from a warmer to a cooler object. 

There are three types of temperature scales: Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. Kelvin starts at absolute zero, Celsius starts at freezing point, and Fahrenheit is dumb. 

Internal energy is the motion of molecules in a type of state of matter; a gas has more internal energy than a liquid which has more energy than a solid. 

The kinetic model of matter states that all matter is made of tiny particles that move randomly and have space between them; this is basically an extension of the internal energy theory. 

Gas laws relate the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas. The pressure varies inversely with its volume and volume varies directly with temperature. The ideal gas law states how to determine the composition of an ideal gas -- a gas with particles that don't attract or repel one another and don't take up space. 

There are 4 types of thermodynamic processes: 

* isothermal, where a system's temperature is constant
* adiabatic, where no heat is exchanged
* isobaric, where the pressure is constant
* isochoric, where the volume is constant. 

The three laws of thermodynamics state that 

* The system's internal energy changes when acted on by an outside energy 
* Energy cannot be passed from colder to warmer substances
* Entropy reaches a constant when the system's temperature goes to absolute zero. 

Heat engines convert heat energy to mechanical energy. Heat pumps transfer heat energy to a thermal reservoir. 

## Gravitation

Gravitational force is is caused by the fact that every particle with mass attracts every other particle with mass with a certain force, however small or large it may be. This attraction is gravitational force. Gravitational fields are the collection of forces a massive object causes due to gravity.

Gravitational potential is the energy stored in an object due to its vertical position. 

Orbital motion is the motion caused when an object is moving forward but is also pulled in another direction due to gravitational attraction from another object. 

## Electrostatics

Resistance is the amount of opposition to current flow in a circuit. Electric cells are batteries that convert chemical energy into electric potential energy. Sources of eMF, electromagnetic fields, include the earth, the sun, and microwaves. Circuit diagrams are the type of diagrams we use when trying to display a circuit. Ohm's law states that the current is directly proportional to voltage. Kirchoff's rules state that 

* The sum of all currents in equal the sum of all currents out
* Any change in a loop must be zero

You can analyze circuits by making tables for each resistor determining the current and voltage running through each part of the circuit in the table and using Ohm's law to determine the missing values. 

Power dissipation is a quantification of the release of heat in a circuit because of inefficiency.
