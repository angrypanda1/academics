# TOK Reflection
The prescribed title I am leaning towards is 
**Statistics conceal as much as they reveal**. Discuss this claim with reference to two areas of knowledge. This year, I am taking AP Statistics, so I am thinking about researching bias and also exploring the unconscious bias in this Prescribed Title. The demands in this statement are implicit, as this statement does not mention any knowledge concepts. However, I think what the statement wants me to do is explore both sides of the argument -- see how statistics unconsciously (or
consciously) conceals data and then compare the magnitude to how much data it reveals.
