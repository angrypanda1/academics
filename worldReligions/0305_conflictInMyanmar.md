# Conflict in Myanmar

## Question

How does the interpretation of Buddhist theology change based on the preferences of the interpreter?

## Evidence

* 90% of Burma is Theravada Buddhist
* However, there are different ethnic groups that don't really like each other which the British took advantage of and used this to screw the country up
* Today, the main scapegoat is the Rohingya Muslims; the Rohingya Genoicde happened in around 2017 and so far, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have been displaced
* Some Buddhist sermons in Burma contain Islamophobic rhetoric, such as encouraging revenge for apparent Muslim violence against Buddhists or Muslim plots to take over the country and crush Buddhism
  * These people defend themselves by citing Buddhist theology and saying that they're not explicitly encouraging Muslim-aimed violence
* Some Buddhists have even tried to advocate for economic/legal oppression of Muslims by such measures as only buying goods from other Buddhists
* On the other hand, many Buddhists have tried to encourage peace with Muslims. These people also use theology in their justification. 

## Conclusion

Buddhists use theology as a way to justify their views, no matter what they are.
