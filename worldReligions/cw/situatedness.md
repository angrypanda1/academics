How does situatedness affect religion?

## Evidence
- **Situatedness**: How multiple perspectives define you
    - The place from where a knowledge claim is made affects the perspective; applies to RELIGION too
        - Scholarly materials, people interpreting them are situated in a certain place; make sure to check how the place you are learning affects your interpretation
        - How does place affect interpretations of certain types of religion? e.g how can one religion in a place be orthodox and another be heretical?
- Situatedness can even affect calendars of the world
    - Ethiopian calendar calculated birth of Jesus 4-5 yrs before us
    - Jordinian calendar has a holy day on Friday so people took the IB test on Sunday and everybody else on Monday
