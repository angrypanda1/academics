# Paul of Tarsus

> Explain Paul’s decision to be inclusive with conversion to Christianity and examine the reasons for controversy behind it. You might have to read the intro some and think.

Paul decided to include the Gentiles in Christianity because he had a revelation from God to function as a prophet for Christianity. However, this caused a lot of controversy because it caused problems with the identities of the early Christians. Since most of the early Christians were Jews who followed most Jewish customs and simply acknowledged Jesus as the new messiah. However, the Gentiles refused to follow Jewish customs, for example refusing to become circumcised. 

> Explain how Paul lays out the idea of salvation through a relationship with Jesus

Paul lays out the idea of salvation through a relationship with Jesus by asserting that God is the one being that can determine if you will achieve salvation; therefore, having a personal relationship with Jesus is optimal in attempting for salvation. 

> Examine the methods Paul uses to try and bring the words and ideas of Jesus to the masses.

Paul focused on major cities as centers for his churches and his sermons to the masses. He also tried to target people of the covenant Jewish synagogues first, since these people were much more religiously knowledgeable and well-known in the places he preached. Paul also tried to preach to as many ethnic groups of possible (such as the Gentiles) but realized that constantly trying to preach to a group that was consistently hostile towards him and his teachings wasn't a very productive way to spread the word of Jesus. Paul also adjusted his sermons for each ethnic group, using proofs from nature that Jesus was the son of God for Gentiles, and using the scriptures for Jews. 

> Justify the quote, “There is no longer Jew or Greek…, slave or free…, male or female…, for all of you are one in Christ Jesus,” with the practice of Judaism--i.e. what has Paul fundamentally changed about the religion?

Paul has fundamentally made the religion itself much more inclusive, with his preachings to many different ethnic groups.
