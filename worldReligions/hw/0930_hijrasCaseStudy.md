# Hinduism Case Study - Gender

## Question
How has the interpretation of gender evolved in India?
## Evidence
- People who aren't male/female have been important in Hinduism are called *hijras*; examples are when Arjuna goes incognito, Mughals patronized third gender people
- It's important to notice that hijras aren't trans, they are a **different gender altogether**; although some of them identify as trans and get gender reassignment procedures
- Hijras have their own secretive community where they learn about the hijra way of life from a *guru*; expected to dance and bless people at weddings; it's considered auspicious
- Hijras are super respected for their religious power
- Even though they are based in Hinduism, a few hijras follow multiple religions
- However, the British screwed the hijras over because they thought the fact that people having a third gender was blasphemy
- Even today, they're discriminated against in employment and they are usually either beggars or prostitutes
- There has been some progress about hijra rights today; a hijra mayor has been elected and there have been education/job reforms for hijras

## Conclusion
The interpretation of gender in India has changed with the religion/people in power -- when Hinduism was the dominant religion, hijras were accepted because the concept of a third gender was considered holy. However, when Christianity and the British were in power, the concept of a gender other than male and female was taboo, so hijras were discriminated against. Unfortunately, this discrimination persisted after India's freedom.
