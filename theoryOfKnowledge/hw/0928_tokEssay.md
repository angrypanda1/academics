# TOK Essay Marking
1. When the author mentions when he first learned about negative numbers, this reminded me of the prisoner in Plato's Cave. The author mentions that when he first learned about negative numbers, he doubted the words of his teacher. The teacher could be one of the ones holding the pots and pans in front of the campfire and the author could be the prisoner that realizes that something is wrong. However, this connection doesn't really work out because later on, the author goes to say that he realizes that the teacher is right. In this case, there are multiple perspectives on whether the author has been enlightened or not by this new knowledge. 

2. 
    1. Level 3 
    2. 5
    3. The essay has a decent argument and supplements it with multiple examples, but the structure isn't good at all. Also, there weren't many knowledge question connections. The multiple examples are a two-sided sword as well -- the reason why the essay is so choppy and disjointed is because of all these examples. The essay can't maintain an even footing in one field, so instead strives to be a jack of all trades, master of none.
