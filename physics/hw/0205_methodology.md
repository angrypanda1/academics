# Methodology Draft

Once again, my hypothesis is: 

*The radius of the frisbee will relate to the distance the frisbee travels parabolically, with an optimal radius for maximum difference and the distance decreasing exponentially as the circumference becomes bigger and smaller than the optimal value.*

My manipulated variable will be the radius of the frisbee, which will be measured in centimeters with a ruler. For my range of values, I will be using 12 centimeters to 16 centimeters, with 0.5 cm intervals, for a total of 9 manipulations. I will do each of these manipulations for 5 trials. I picked these values due to the radius for the Frisbee that I have used being 12 cm. It is nearly impossible for me to reduce the radius of the frisbee using power tools accurately, so I will just measure the distance the frisbee goes if the radius increases. I expect a decline in distance if the radius gets bigger, since there has to be a reason that all Frisbees are usually the same size. . I am using an architect's ruler, which has a uncertainty of $\pm \ 0.025$ centimeters, which will be adequate for my measurement. My validity measure is if the responding variable varies dramatically from the expected value in the trial. 

My responding variable is the distance that the frisbee flies, measured in meters. I will be measuring it using a meter stick, which has an uncertainty of $\pm \ 0.1$ centimeters. To help keep the responding variable safe, I will use a stand for the frisbee to keep the same angle throughout all the trials and use the same pushing motion with my hand to attempt to keep the speed the same. I recognize that the speed of my hand might affect the Frisbee's distance, and will account for variations in hand speed with uncertainty. 

My controlled variables are: 

* Angle that the frisbee flies; if the angle differs drastically, the distance the frisbee flies differs equally as drastically, since a Frisbee's flying distance is dependent on the amount of air lift beneath it, which is changed by the angle. I will try to keep the angle the same by using a ramp to launch the frisbee from. Since the ramp is unlikely to change angles in the space of a few trials, I will measure the angle of the ramp every four trials with a protractor. 
* The wind speed; if the wind differs drastically, the distance the frisbee flies will differ equally as drastically, since a Frisbee's flying distance is dependent on the amount of air lift beneath it, which is changed by the wind speed. I will try to keep the wind speed the same by conducting the experiment on a calm day, and waiting until I can feel no wind to start a trial. 
* The hand speed; if the hand speed differs drastically, the distance the frisbee flies will differ equally as drastically, since a Frisbee's flying distance is dependent on the speed at which it is launched. I will try to keep the speed the frisbee is launched at the same by using the same hand motion, and attempting to keep the speed the same. I have no way to verify that I am using close to the exact same speed for each trial, so I will have to eyeball it. 

## Materials

* A frisbee with radius 12 cm. 
* A ruler to check the radius of the frisbee
* A meter stick to check the distance of the frisbee
* A wooden ramp with an incline of approximately 15 degrees, measured with a protractor
* Paper, scissors, and tape
* An assistant to measure where the frisbee touches down

## Procedure

1. You will need a wide open space for this experiment. Set the frisbee at the bottom of the ramp and clear space up for the trajectory of the frisbee. 
2. With one smooth motion, push the frisbee off the ramp, putting your hand on the top of the frisbee. Make sure your assistant is ready to mark down the exact place where the frisbee touches the ground. 
3. Measure the distance the frisbee travels from the ramp to the place it touches down with the meter stick and record the value. 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 four more times. 
5. Use scissors to cut out a hollow circle with that has a border radius of 0.5 inches. Tape this to the outside of the frisbee. 
6. Repeat steps 2-4. 
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 7 more times, each time adding a circle to the outside of the frisbee. 

## Safety Precautions

As you are throwing objects,you are recommended to wear goggles while doing this experiment. Additionally, makes sure that the area around the Frisbee's flight path is clear of people and objects.
