# IA Project Primer

> What are your initial knowledge on the authenticity of the IA project work? How well do you think you are prepared for the authenticity and ethical guidelines? 

I think I am well prepared for the authenticity and ethical guidelines. I am aware of the penalties incurred on not displaying authentic code of yours without proper citation in your IA. 

> Who will be your client and advisors?

Both my client and advisor will be my father.

> Are you planning to learn a new technology and implement as your solution for your client?

I am not planning to learn a new technology, as I already know Java and HTML/CSS and am planning to make a webpage to integrate into an already existing website.
