# Unit 2

## 2.1

* Useful theory by a Russian mathematician:

> Given a number greater than or equal to 1 and a set of $n$ measurements, at least $[1 - (1/k^2)]$ of the measurements will lie within $k$ standard deviations of their mean.

* This is useful because it applies to *any* measurements (e.g. you can use it for both sample and population)
* You can illustrate it graphically like so:

* From this theorem, we find out the **Empirical Rule**:

> Given a distribution of measurements that is approximately mount-shaped:
>
> * The interval $(u\ \pm\ \sigma)$ contains approximately $68\%$ of the measurements
> * The interval $(u\ \pm\ 2\sigma)$ contains approximately $95\%$ of the measurements
> * The interval $(u\ \pm \ 3\sigma)$ contains approximately $99.7\%$ of the measurements

* This rule helps us create the **normal distribution**, which is basically a histogram with an infinite number of classes. Think Riemann sums. This distribution is important for two reasons:

  * Many normally distributed populations exist
  * The Central Limit Theorem (more about this later)
* The mean/median/mode are all in the same place in a normal curve. 
* Normal curves are determined by two things:

  * Population mean
  * Population SD
* The area under a normal curve **always** equals 1 because the normal curve is also a probability curve.

## 2.3

* Normal curve describes **many** naturally occurring distributions
* You can check if a set of data makes up a normal distribution with the empirical rule 
  * Say you have a set of data; find $\bar{x}$ and $s$, determine the intervals that are in the range of 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean, count the values for each interval and therefore liken each interval to a percent of the sample population. Check if these are close to 68%, 95%, and 99.7% respectively, and draw a conclusion.
