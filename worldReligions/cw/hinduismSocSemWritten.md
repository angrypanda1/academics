# Hinduism Socratic Seminar Written Assignment

1. Compare and contrast "Feet like Lotus Powder" with the various bhakti poetry. Examine the internal diversity within bhakti, including different values and goals of reaching the divine. 

In *Feet Like Lotus Powder*, the main goal of the poet is to espouse the qualities of Shiva, mainly his feet. (I'll let you assume what comes next.) However, in the various bhakti poetry excerpts in pp. 480-485, the main goal is to emphasize renunciation of the world and recognition that everyone is a part of Brahman, or the eternal, world soul. In other differences, the *bhakti* in *Feet like Lotus Powder* is much more emotional, with the poet describing "the slightest thought of
leaving [Shiva] [as] painful." Conversely, one of the various bhakti poetry describes Hari in this way: "Hari, you are cruel and without qualities, you've no compassion, you're very hard, you do what is unimaginable -- what no one else has done."
