# Kant's Categorical Imperative

* There is only one categorical imperative: only do an action as if you are able to will it as a universal law. 
* An example: a man is tired of life and wants to kill himself, but considers his action from the lens of it being a categorical imperative.
  * His reason for killing himself is to avoid any more bad things to happen to his person. Now, considering this as a universal law, this would make no sense, since the purpose of life is to propagate more life, making the maxim incorrect.
* Another example: a man wants to borrow money, but knows he must lie to get the money on credit and say that he is able to pay it back. Now, considering this as a universal law of nature, it would completely screw society up. Therefore, it is immoral to do this. 
* A man is super talented but would rather enjoy himself rather than help people with his talent. If this was a universal law of nature, society would collapse. 
* A man who is rich does not want to help someone who is poor because it's none of his business. If this was a universal law of nature

# Jeremy Bentham's Hedonistic Calculus

* Humans operate all of their actions based on the amount of pain or pleasure an action gives
* Utility itself is defined as the amount of pain or pleasure an object provides so utilitarianism is ultimately just hedonistic calculus
  * For example, being utilitarian on a decision for a population is simply just deciding which decision will give the population the most pleasure and the least pain
* The interests of a community are the sum of the parts of the interests of individuals in that community
* Being completely opposed to this "principle of utility" is called asceticism, and being somewhat opposed to it but somewhat supporting it is called sympathy/empathy
* Asceticism is just people realizing that good stuff isn't very good in the long run and overcompensating by promoting pain-inducing stuff
* The more consistently the principle of utility is pursued, the better for humankind.
* The amount of pain and pleasure is measured by 4 factors: 
  * intensity
  * duration
  * certainty/uncertainty
  * remoteness
* He then goes into an extremely detailed but kind of stupid procedure on how exactly to measure pain or pleasure
* Pain/pleasure shouldn't be used for *every* legislative decision, but it should always be considered

1. Considering Bentham's Calculus, how well would it work if used as a system of governing one's own actions?

I don't think it would be a very good factor in governing one's own actions, unless done properly. Let's say you have to decide whether to talk to your annoying boss about a raise. This will cause you pain -- in the short term. However, if you do manage to get a raise, you will be happier long-term. Always prioritize long-term pleasure and I think using hedonistic calculus would make a fine decision-making strategy. 

2. What if Bentham's utilitarianism were used as a parenting strategy? How much would you like your parents to use it as a system of governing? 

It would not be a very good system of governing, as it is a little different with kids. Constantly prioritizing the kids' short term pleasure would not be conducive to maintaining their physical -- and emotional -- health and would not be a good way to prepare them for the future challenges of being an adult. I would hate for my parents to use this strategy -- to be honest, being a spoiled brat is basically the product of parents using hedonistic calculus multiple times over. 

3. How effective would the system be at governing the federal government? Pick one contemporary issue and apply it. 

I think the system would be a good way for a government to rule its people -- if its people were morally perfect. This sounds a lot like communism to me -- prioritizing the pleasure and minimizing the pain of the greater good. It never works because humans are selfish creatures. In the case that all humans were perfect beings who all had a grasp on this hedonistic calculus concept, then yeah, it would be a good way for a government to rule. 

An example of a contemporary issue: gun control. Allowing guns validates the pleasures of a small group of gun-owning people, heavily controlling guns minimizes the pain (worry of violence) of a large part of the population. Therefore, using Bentham's theory, having gun control is the best solution. 

# John Stuart Mill -- Utilitarianism

* Actions are right in proportion to their promoting happiness. BRUH THIS IS LITERALLY THE EXACT SAME AS THE PREVIOUS ARTICLE
* Yeah this is just a much more succinct summary of Bentham's theory

1. How does Mill's view differ from your philosophy? 

Mill's view differs from my philosophy in that I feel his philosophy is much more short-term. "Actions are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves...". It makes sense to have this mindset for long-term decisions and goals, but this mindset isn't conducive at all to short-term decisions. For example, I want to eat a donut now, because it will provide me with pleasure. However, I know in the long-term that eating this donut will give a bigger chance at getting cavities, worse breath, and more weight. Therefore, I agree with Mill's view for long-term goals, but not for short-term ones. 

# Aristotle -- Science, Politics, and Ethics

* Rationalism was advocated by Plato, but Aristotle also wanted to take into account experiences with nature
* Aristotle based his ethics on reason; people can have good lives if they choose moderation in all that they do
* A community is a group of people, but a state is something created to help that community have a good quality of life
* The only just sovereign method of rule is to have the majority rule (democracy) 
* It is best to live a life of moderation (similar to Buddhism). Therefore, own a middling amount of items. People who have extreme personalities on either side of the spectrum don't succeed; only people in the middle do
* You should be moderate in your ethics too; don't go too far to either side and you'll be fine

1. What evidence in Aristotle's description of chick embryo development illustrates his use of empirical methods of scientific inquiry? 

   The empirical methods of scientific inquiry include very careful observation, as Aristotle demonstrates by observing which direction in which the egg grows. He also uses multiple trials in his experiment, as observed by his observation of removed eyes, implying that he used at least two trials -- one where the eyes were removed and one where the chick was allowed to grow to full size. 

2. Why did Aristotle believe that state power was best left in the hands of the middle classes? Why did he fear government by the poor, the tyrant, the few, the good, or the rich?

   Aristotle believed that the middle class would be the best at ruling since they were the most moderate in terms of classes; they want nothing and they want for nothing. As for the rest: 

   * The poor: They are "delinquent" and "wicked in petty ways". They are also too subservient. 
   * The rich: They commit "crimes on a large scale". They are too full of their own superiority to do any actual work. 
   * The tyrant: The few but worse because the tyrant has more right to use force
   * The few: Aristotle thinks that too few people ruling would result in them robbing everyone else and keeping it for themselves
   * The many: distributing the wealth of a few people to the rest of the population isn't exactly just
   * The good: This means that people who are not "good" are completely barred from participating in the government. How do you decide which people are good? 

3. According to Aristotle, how did the "proud man", a man of excellence, relate to others? To worldly success and riches? 

   The "proud man", contrary to his name, does not become overly proud when good fortune befalls him. In fact, his reactions are moderate to everything that happens to him. The proud man gives things to others but does not like receiving things. 

4. What kind of moral values did the proud man cultivate?

   The proud man's morals are to be humble (???) and to not be jealous. He does not gossip. He takes most things seriously. In other words, he is moderate in all of his actions. 

5. Aristotle urged both self-sufficiency and moderation as guiding principles in human life. In what specific ways would the proud man demonstrate these virtues? 

   The proud man would demonstrate his self-sufficiency in his not needing approval from other people for his own happiness. The proud man demonstrates moderation in all of his actions, neither going over the top or under-performing in anything.
