# Alchemy Explained

## Evidence

- Chinese "alchemy" is the oldest in the world; alchemy derived from a Chinese word

- Main aim of alchemy is the search for an elixir that produces immortality

- Experiments produced gunpowder and contributions to Chinese pharma

- Gold and mercury are the "interactions of cosmic energies" and make up the quintessence of our planet

- Taoist alchemy aims to refine raw ingredients to find the very essence of the world (which will probably give drinker immortality if ingested)

- Bronze and iron also caused the development of alchemy

- Chinese alchemy fills vessels with "cinnibar" the thing that creates gold

- There's a manual that details exactly what effects happen after each transmutation of cinnabar
