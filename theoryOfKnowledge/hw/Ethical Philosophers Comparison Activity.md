# Ethical Philosophers Comparison Activity

## Table 1

|                     |          Are we morally obligated to help the poor?          |
| :-----------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Aristotle would say | Aristotle's main method of saying if something is ethical or not is checking if the action is moderate. If we barely help the poor at all, it is not ethical since we have the means to help fellow humans in need and choose not to, and if we help the poor too much, it is not ethical to them because they will become too used to receiving help and will be unable to function for themselves. Therefore, adopting a moderate approach towards helping the poor is the best stance. |
|  Bentham would say  | Bentham's decision in deciding if an action is moral is if it causes the most pleasure and the least pain. Since the rich are (usually) a minority and the poorer classes are (usually) a majority, helping the poor will result in a majority of the population having more pleasure and a minority of the population experiencing pain -- though not that much, if they are rich. However, we must consider the effects in the long-term as well; if rich people help the poor too much, it will cause long-term pain on both sides, since the rich will lose a great deal of money, and the poor will have no idea how to be self-sufficient and maintain their newfound wealth. |
|   Kant would say    | Kant's method of deciding if something is ethical is to check if the action could be used as a universal law. If "helping the poor" was a universal law, regardless of who was in power or wealthy, society would be much better off on the whole. Therefore, helping the poor is ethical. |
|   Mill would say    | Mill's decision in deciding if an action is moral is if it causes the most pleasure and the least pain. Since the rich are (usually) a minority and the poorer classes are (usually) a majority, helping the poor will result in a majority of the population having more pleasure and a minority of the population experiencing pain -- though not that much, if they are rich. However, we must consider the effects in the long-term as well; if rich people help the poor too much, it will cause long-term pain on both sides, since the rich will lose a great deal of money, and the poor will have no idea how to be self-sufficient and maintain their newfound wealth. |

## Table 2

|                     |                 Is it wrong to kill people?                  |
| :-----------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Aristotle would say | Is killing a person a moderate thing to do in the long run? If the person is threatening your family, do you kill him? In this case, since your are making sure your family does not have a member harmed to keep the moderate dynamic of your family strong, you should kill the person. Otherwise, since you are taking the life of the person (an extreme thing to do, so therefore not moderate) it is unethical. |
|  Bentham would say  | Decide how many people will experience pleasure or pain if the person dies. If more people experience pleasure, it is ethical to kill the person; if more people experience pain, it is unethical to kill the person. |
|   Kant would say    | If killing people was a universal law, society would collapse into anarchy. Therefore, it is unethical to kill a person. |
|   Mill would say    | Decide how many people will experience pleasure or pain if the person dies. If more people experience pleasure, it is ethical to kill the person; if more people experience pain, it is unethical to kill the person. |

## Table 3

|                     |               Is war ever morally permissible?               |
| :-----------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Aristotle would say | Aristotle advocates approaching every moral problem as an issue of moderation; in this case, we have to find if the reason for waging (or not waging) a war is too extreme. For example, if we participate in a war for the sole purpose of obtaining more money for ourselves, then war is not morally permissible. If, however, we participate in a war for humanitarian reasons, then war is morally permissible. |
|  Bentham would say  | We must determine how much pain or pleasure the war will cause in order to determine if waging a war is ethical. If winning the war will cause less pain and more pleasure on more people overall, it is ethical, and vice versa. |
|   Kant would say    | If waging war constantly was a universal law, society would collapse. Therefore, war is unethical. |
|   Mill would say    | We must determine how much pain or pleasure the war will cause in order to determine if waging a war is ethical. If winning the war will cause less pain and more pleasure on more people overall, it is ethical, and vice versa. |

## Table 4

|                     | Is it unethical for farmers to throw away weirdly shaped vegetables? |
| :-----------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Aristotle would say | Is throwing away food purely based on cosmetic value a moderate thing to do? No, therefore it is unethical. |
|  Bentham would say  | More people experience pain from not being able to eat perfectly fine food than people who experience pleasure from eating good-looking food; therefore, it is unethical. |
|   Kant would say    | If everybody threw away bad-looking food, more people would be hungry, causing more societal instability. Therefore, it is unethical. |
|   Mill would say    | More people experience pain from not being able to eat perfectly fine food than people who experience pleasure from eating good-looking food; therefore, it is unethical. |

*x-axis*: This axis deals with how rigid the concept of "ethics" is. Good being objectives means that the concept of good is unchangeable, and applies to all situations to the same extent and way. Good being subjective is the opposite; the concept of good is malleable, and can be applied to different situations in different ways. 

*y-axis*: This axis deals with how many people decide if something is good or not. The bottom half of the axis asserts that the majority determines what is good and ethical; the top half of the axis asserts that the individual asserts what is good and ethical for every action they take. 

*z-axis* (to what extent is government involvement needed?)

*Aristotle*: Aristotle's system of ethics is largely individual, so he would dislike any involvement of the government in determining a person's ethics. 

*Kant*: Kant's system of ethics is thinking of the consequences of ever action you take as if it were a universal rule. Kant would most likely desire some government intervention. since he mentions "society" and "universal rules" a great deal, but would still like to maintain some semblance of individuality. 

*Bentham and Mill*: Bentham and Mill are the most favorable towards government intervention, since most of their doctrines assume the reader is some sort of leader, telling the reader to measure the consequences of their actions on themselves and (mostly) on other people from a scale of pain to pleasure.
