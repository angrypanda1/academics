| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|              Define the AOK in your own words.               | History can be defined as the study of events that happened in the past. These don't have to include just humans, however -- paleontology, the study of fossils, is also a type of history. |
| What is the purpose of the AOK? What does it tell about the world & how we can apply it? If we can't what is it good for? | The purpose of studying history is to use knowledge gained from past events in the future. For example, the policy of appeasement in WW2 to keep Hitler from invading Europe didn't work, and we will probably never use it again. |
| How do we make knowledge in this area? What methods are used? How do we do what we do in this AOK? | We study history by consulting several types of sources dealing with the specific subtopic we want to discuss, in order to have a more balanced perspective of the knowledge gained from studying this subtopic |
| What values do we apply to these processes? Are there rules that we follow? Any systems? | Usually, history is concerned with establishing the validity of that source (in other words, if the author of that source is to be trusted) in order to avoid having a biased view. |
|     What are some examples of practitioners of this AOK?     | Examples of practitioners of History include conventional historians, paleontologists, military buffs, or practically anybody who studies the past. Personal knowledge does not play a large role in this area of knowledge since history is a collective subject -- whichever perspective is more popular becomes the conventional, orthodox view (*Kind of like Structure!*) |
|        What is the origin and/or history of the AOK?         | Probably since humanity first began and we started thinking about the past, synthesizing knowledge from it, and using that knowledge in the future. Probably even before humanity; evolution is a form of history as well in that the species that didn't die out were the ones that "utilized" their knowledge from the past best, albeit accidentally. |
|     Who uses this area of knowledge? For what purposes?      | Practically everybody, but usually in a short-term sense. As said before, people use knowledge gleaned from studying history to have more success in the future. |
|             Is this AOK discovered or invented?              | Half and half. You can't invent events that haven't happened yet but those events that you do end up accidentally inventing become part of history. However, discovering key sources that describe a specific event is also a very important part of studying history. |
| What is the relationship between this area of knowledge and reality? | History strives to accurately describe past realities, so I would say the relationship between history and realities is extremely important, and does matter. If your history doesn't accurately describe past realities, then it isn't correct and therefore not history. |
