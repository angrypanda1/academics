# Karmamarga
**Marga**: a path forward/way attaining *moksha*

**Karmamarga**: Do good deeds to attain moksha/live a better next life.

## Notes ##
* Do good deeds = form of prayer
* People should act to preserve *dharma*
* People should not be attached to the fruits of their labor or counting their chickens before they're hatched; reason is that if people are attached to fruits, more self-destructive behavior will occur
* Krishna in the *Bhagavad-Gita* summarizes it pretty well:
> Therefore, without being attached to the results of activites, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme. 
* Important texts are the *Bhagavad-Gita*, some of the *Upanishads*, the *Bhagavata Purana*. 
* There isn't a specific God; Karma-marga is usually mentioned in tandem with the other two margas; Bhakti and Jnana. However, I think Rama exemplifies karma-marga the most; doing his duty to his father (and Kaikeyi) by going into the forest, rescuing Sita from Ravana, etc. 
* An especially big proponent of karma-marga was Swami Vivekananda; established the **Ramakrishna Order** which strives to provide relief from natural disasters and wars
