- **INDIA**
    - Show how Hinduism has affected India beneficially
        - "Gandhi did not separate religion from politics. He brought a religious ethic to politics rather than political militancy into religious communities."
        - "In cultural matters, Gandhi was an assimilationist, not in the sense that he wanted other cultures to be integrated into his own, but rather that all cultures to be enriched by each other without losing their specific identities."
        - "[Gandhi's]...respect for all religions implies not just a radical faith in the validity of all religions, but further a fundamental faith in the adequacy of each religion for all those born into it."
        - TALK ABOUT SWAMI VIVEKANANDA AND HOW HE ENCOURAGED REBELLION AGAINST THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. 
        - "[Vivekananda] was the first Indian patriot to inspire the political ideologies of revolutionaries against the British Government."
        - "After having gone through the works of Vivekananda, the love that I had for my country became a thousand fold."
        - "He was no politician in the ordinary sense of the word and yet he was, I think, one of the great founders -- if you like, you may use any other word -- of the national modern movement of India, and a great number of people who took more or less an active part in that movement in a later date drew their inspiration from Swami Vivekananda.."
        - "In the words of Swami Vivekananda, we have never dipped our hands in the neighbour's blood, our embattled cohorts have never marched into other lands for conquest, and we have always been the harbingers of peace and the makers of peace in this war-torn, war-weary world."
        - "[Because the Western world doesn't have spirituality], India has to import this rich spiritual treasure, this message of hers to the west. If we are to do that ...this right must be inherent, -- the right to profess and propagate her religious faith must be conceded."
        - "Though the swami never gave any political message, everyone who came into contact with him or is writings developed a spirit of patriotism and a political mentality."
        - "No one ever landed on English soil with more hatred in his heart for a race than I did for the English...but...I found where the heartbeat of [England] was, and the more I loved [the English]...This attitude of Vivekananda contributed much to quench the fires of hate blazing against the English in many die-hard promoters of Indian Independence."
        - "I am firmly persuaded that without the help of practical Islam, theories of vedantism, however fine and wonderful they may be are entirely valueless to the vast mass of mankind...Mankind ought to be taught that religions are but the varied expressions of THE RELIGION, which is oneness."
        - "The idea that one man is born superior to another has no meaning in Vedanta...if the Brahmin has more aptitude for learning on the gruond of heredity than the Pariah, spend no more money on the Brahmin's education, but spend all on the Pariah. Give to the weak, for there all the gift is needed."
        - 
    - Show how Hinduism has affected India detrimentally
        - "As the Muslim rulers succeeded each other, their policy towards their Hindu subjects and those of other religions varied: some rulers were rigorous...other rulers were tolerant..."
        - "In the 19th century, to stabilize their control, the British colonial rulers practiced a policy of "divide and rule", especially by introducing a system of "communal" and "special" representation and separate electorates which increased religious hostility and undermined the National Congress's effort to speak for both Hindus and Muslims."...
        - "Until the end of the 1960s, Muslims and Hindus lived peaceably...with the rise of religious and nationalistic Hindu organizations and parties tension between Hindus and Muslims has grown."
            - Examples: Babri Mosque, Gujarat pogrom
        - "At the partition of India in 1947...Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs were forced to leave their homes in a mass exodus of over 12 million people accompanied by horrible massacres where the streams of refugees crossed each other's paths."
        - "Emerging religious demands...led, in the 1980s to a violent confrontation between the Sikh organization Akali Dal and the central government under Indira Gandhi...In June 1984, the attempt to storm the Golden Temple...proved a disaster for Indira Gandhi. In October she was shot by two of her Sikh bodyguards."
        - "The failure of the moderate politics of...Nehru to avert the partition of India played into the hands of those religious nationalists who continued to dream the unfulfilled dream of an undivided India under Hindu rule."
        - "Founded in 1925...the RSS has the goal "to unify India under the saffron flag, a symbol of Hindu power deriving from the reign of Shivaji, an eighteenth-century Hindu prince who conducted a brief rebellion against the Muslim empire -- to declare India a nation unified by a single culture and a holy land that is the same time the motherland.""
        - "Thus, following Golwalkar's line, today's right-wing Hindus are above all concerned with "the loyalty to the land with its Hindu traditions, and to their own religion with its culture and its own sources of ethical and spiritual authority.""
        - "Thus, for instance appealing to the *Mahabharata*, they emphasize the combative tradition of Hinduism...whereas Rama's enemy was originally the King of the Demons, Ravana, his enemy now becomes the Muslims."
        - "The development of the BJP...shows that these groups have only been able to play the Hindu-nationalist card successfully as long as dissatisfaction with the secular Congress party government prevailed"
        - "Savarkar's Hindutva ideology was narrow and exclusivist in its conflation of *janma bhoomi* and *punya bhoomi*"
        - "With Savarkar, there is an emphatic distinction between Hinduism as a religious sytem and Hinduism as a political ideology."
        - "For Gandhi, "god is love" is too ambiguous. He prefers "god is truth", and finally even reverses this to "truth is god"".
        - "Hindutva defines India as Hindu and wants all Indians to be Hindus. Indeed, it is but a contemporary avatar of an older and more chauvinistic brahmanism."
        - "When the traditional Hindu upper caste elites finally recognized the challenge [Gandhi's religious views] posed, they inevitably felt threatened and vehemently opposed him."
        - "The aggressive pursuit of a hardline Hindu agenda by the...BJP...is deepening the insecurities of India's religious minorities, especially Muslims"
        - "Under Narendra Modi, cities bearing Islamic names are being renamed. History textbooks are being re-written to legitimise Hindu nationalist ideology; text that contradicts this is being deleted."
        - "Muslims are being accused of waging a 'corona-jihad' in India, of spreading the coronavirus deliberately among Indians."
        - "Hindutva is a modern political ideology that views India as a Hindu nation and defines Indian culture in terms of Hindu cultural values."
        - "Muslims have been called 'Pakistanis' and reviled as 'traitors' and 'terrorists' for decades, whether in films or the mainstream media."
        - "Muslim men are often depicted as sexual predators and philanderers"
        - "Hindutva activists accuse Muslim men of luring 'gullible' Hindu women into marriage, forcibly converting them to Islam and thus waging a 'love jihad' against Hindus."
        - "Since the late 19th century, the cow has emerged as an important symbol of Hindu nationalism...Hindutva activists justify violence against them as an act of cow protection and therefore a 'sacred duty'."
        - "On July 30, 2019, parliament enacted legislation criminalizing 'triple talaq', a Muslim practice of 'instant divorce'...However it undermines the constitutional right of Muslims to have their own personal laws, i.e. on matters related to marriage, divorce, maintenance, etc."
        - "The use of force to disperse [Muslims] to choose non-political means. There is a danger of Muslim anger erupting into violence..."
