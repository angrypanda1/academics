## Vishnu 

Vishnu is considered one of the holy trinity of Hinduism -- Bramha, Vishnu, and Shiva. He is one of the most popular worshipped gods in the Hindu pantheon, with Vaishnavism being Hinduism's largest sect. In some text, Vishnu is even portrayed to be better than the other gods in the holy trinity -- for example, Brahma is said to have been born from a lotus forming in Vishnu's navel. Additionally, each of the three gods of the trinity have a responsibility -- Brahma created the world, Vishnu maintains it, and Shiva will destroy it. 

Vishnu has ten avatars: Buddha, Krishna, Rama, Parasurama, Narasimha, Vamana, Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, and he will be Kalki when the world ends. Of these, the stories of Buddha, Krishna, and Rama are the more important -- or at least, more popular -- than the other seven. The *Ramayana* details the story of Rama, the *Mahabharata* and *Bhagavad-Gita* details (a part) of Krishna's life and identity, and the Buddha, is, well, the Buddha. Some holy sites for Vaishnavites include Mathura (Krishna's birthplace/the place where he killed Kamsa), Dwaraka (Krishna's city), and Ayodhya (Rama's kingdom). 

Probably the most popular story for Vaishnavites is the *Ramayana*. This is probably because Rama is one of the more accessible avatars, and he offers a model that people can live up to while being exiled to the forest and having his wife kidnapped :(

As said before, Vaishnavism is now the most popular sect in Hinduism, probably because of the ISKCON movement (which, incidentally, has a temple right next to our school). Additionally, the movement spread a lot in India during medieval times because of the *bhakti* movement, which emphasizes accessibility to spirituality, regardless of caste/gender.

## Shiva

Shiva is also one of the holy trinity of Hinduism -- Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. Shiva is responsible for the destruction of the world. He has a third eye that represents his wisdom/power, a cobra necklace because he has a special relationship with snakes, and a trident for the three functions of the Hindu Trinity (holy trinity?). He is also responsible for protecting the Vedas.

Important stories about Shiva include his wedding to Lady Parvati, the birth of Ganesha, how his third eye was created, and the creation of the Shiva Linga (ew.). Holy sites for Shiva include Rameshwaram, Varanasi, and Mount Kailas. Shaivism is the second most popular sect of Hinduism, with many Shaivites in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Shaivism has ebbed and flowed with the ages; when Raja Raja Chola was king, the entirety of South India was Shaivites

## Brahma

Brahma is the last of the Hindu trinity. Brahma is responsible for the creation of the world. He symbolizes knowledge, and he always is shown sitting on a lotus, a symbol of purity and divinity. 

Important stories about Brahma include his birth; he was birthed from a golden egg and created the universe. If you want another option, some stories also say he was birthed from a lotus coming out of Lord Vishnu's/Shiva's novel. 

Brahma is less popular than other gods because..well...I actually don't know. He signifies a bunch of good things, like purity and knowledge. I wonder why people pray to Shiva instead of him...in the stories, Shiva is portray as much more morally lax than Brahma, accepting offers of meat (meat! The blasphemy!).
