# Probability 

1. You roll a pair of standard dice. Create the sample space for a single roll of the dice and use the sample space to compute the following probabilities. 

> Create a sample space. 

```markdown
{[2][1], [2][2], [2][3], [2][4],[2][5], [2][6],
[3][1], [3][2], [3][3], [3][4], [3][5], [3][6],
[4][1], [4][2], [4][3], [4][4], [4][5], [4][6],
[5][1], [5][2], [5][3], [5][4], [5][5], [5][6],
[6][1], [6][2], [6][3], [6][4], [6][5], [6][6]}
```

> $P$(getting a 1 on the first die *or* getting a 5 on the second die)

$$
\frac{1}{3}
$$

> $P$(sum of the dice=10)

$$
\frac{1}{12}
$$

> $P$(getting a 3 on the second die *given that* you got a 2 on the first die)

$$
\frac{1}{6}
$$

> $P$(getting an odd number on the first die *and* a value greater than 4 on the second die)

$$
\frac{1}{6}
$$

2. Below is some hypothetical data on the voting preferences of individuals of different religious affiliations. 

> $P$(Vote for Orange Party)

$$
0.126
$$

> $P$(Vote for Green Party *or* Religion C)

$$
0.591
$$

> $P$(Vote for Blue party, *given that* individual is Religion C)

$$
0.374
$$

> $P$(Religion B, *given that* individual voted for Orange Party)

$$
0.302
$$

3. The hypothetical probabilities of types of weather in two neighborhoods on an average day in the month of August are shown below: 

> $P$(fog in the Western neighborhood *and* sunshine in the Central neighborhood)

$$
0.35
$$

> $P$(sunny on August 1 in the Western neighborhood for three consecutive years)

$$
0.04
$$

> $P$(fog in the Western neighborhood or fog in the Central neighborhood)

$$
0.55
$$

> $P$(rain in the Central neighborhood given that it is not sunny in the Central neighborhood)

$$
0.66
$$

4. In a random sample of male and female graduates of the New York School for the Arts between the ages of 22-35 you know that:

> $P$(man is a ballet dancer and a musical performer)

$$
0.089
$$

> $P$(woman is an actress and a musical performer)

$$
0.201
$$

> $P$(woman is an actress or a musical performer)

$$
0.714
$$

5. A college students frequents one of two coffee houses on campus, choosing Starbucks 70% of the time and Peetes 30% of the time. Regardless of where she goes, she buys a cafe mocha on 60% of her visits. 

> Probability of going to Starbucks and ordering a cafe mocha

$$
0.42
$$

> Are the two events in part A independent? 

Yes. 

> Probability of (Peete's | ordered a mocha)

$$
0.3
$$

> Probability of Starbucks or orders Cafe mocha

$$
0.88
$$

6. Whether a grant proposal is funded quite often depends on the reviewers. Suppose a group of research proposals was evaluated by a group of experts as to whether the proposals were worthy of funding. When these same proposals were submitted to a second independent group or experts, the decision to fund was reversed in 30% of the cases. If the probability that a proposal is approved for funding by the first peer review group is .2, what are the probabilities of these events? 

> Proposal is approved by both groups

$$
0.06
$$

> Proposal disapproved by both groups

$$
0.56
$$

> Proposal is approved by only one group 

$$
0.44
$$
